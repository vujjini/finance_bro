We recently published a list of 12 Best Tech Stocks to Buy For Long-Term Investment. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands against other tech stocks to buy for long-term investment.
On April 1, Chris Verrone, chief market strategist at Strategas Research Partners, appeared on CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ to talk about his outlook on the tech sector. Verrone believes that most of the current market’s negative sentiment has already been factored into recent stock prices. He highlighted that even after the market’s decline, the VIX, and the currency and bond volatility are lower than they were during the mid-March stress period. Plus, fewer stocks are hitting new lows. He thinks that market lows are formed during periods of bad news, and the market will rally from its current level with an anticipated range of 5,900 to 5,950.
Verrone believes that the current downturn is more than a typical 10% correction so it will take some time to figure out the market’s true direction. He emphasized the importance of monitoring market breadth, new highs, and credit conditions in the upcoming weeks and months. He also acknowledged the shift in investor sentiment, with more bears than bulls. As the conversation touched on the impact of the Fed and politics in a market, Verrone stated that he pays more attention to what the 2-year Treasury yield tells him instead of listening to what Fed officials have to say. He noted that the 2-year yield’s decline from 3.83% to 3.85% suggests a shift in the market expectations for the Fed’s actions. He highlighted the resilience of financials during the correction and contrasted it with the weakness of tech. He thinks that, unlike financials that entered the correction as leaders, the tech sector might not be able to regain the leadership role.
While Verrone’s stance acknowledges the current weakness in tech, it’s important to note that the tech sector remains one of the more innovative markets in the long run. For instance, MAG7 continues to be a driving force for this market.
We first sifted through financial media reports to compile a list of the top tech stocks that are being touted as long term investment plays. We then selected the 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) develops and supports global software, services, devices, and solutions. One of its business segments includes Productivity and Business Processes which offers Microsoft Teams, office 365 Security and Compliance, Microsoft 365 Copilot, and others. It also provides LinkedIn, on-premises ERP, and CRM applications.
The company’s Intelligent Cloud segment offers server products and cloud services. It’s primarily driven by Azure and achieved $25.5 billion in FQ2 2o25 revenue, which was up 19% year-over-year. This was fueled by the expanding AI services, which saw a 157% revenue increase. The AI business recorded an annual revenue run rate of $13 billion, which was up 175%. The company has more than doubled its data center capacity in the last 3 years, with the highest expansions made last year to ensure supporting the current cloud workloads and next-gen AI applications.
Azure AI Foundry, which is Microsoft Corp.’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) AI platform has 200,000+ monthly active users within just 2 months of its launch. It provides tools for AI development which includes support for OpenAI’s leading models and open-source models like DeepSeek’s R1. Similarly, Copilot Studio creates custom AI agents and has seen 160,000 organizations create 400,000 agents in just 3 months. Piper Sandler maintained an Overweight rating with a $520 price target on the company because they believe in its AI-driven cloud, productivity, and business offerings.
Columbia Seligman Global Technology Fund stated the following regarding Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in its Q4 2024 investor letter, believing that Oracle is positioned to capitalize on the AI-driven cloud demand:
“Within software, the fund maintained an underweight position to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which proved beneficial as share price for the company fell during the fourth quarter. Microsoft’s outlook for its Azure business came down slightly, which hampered the stock price at times during the quarter and, combined with losses on the Open AI business, led to a disappointing end to 2024. The company has guided its capital expenditure spending up slightly and investors continue to wait for additional monetization from the company’s large commitment to AI infrastructure spending. The fund continued to hold an overweight allocation to Oracle as we believe Oracle is positioned to be a major beneficiary of the AI rollout and has the potential to compete with other large cloud providers, such as Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft. Oracle shares moved lower during the quarter and the stock suffered its worst day of the year in December, as the company narrowly underperformed analysts’ average estimates. Oracle’s business model remains strong as demand for computer power that can handle AI is increasing and the company’s revenues from its cloud infrastructure unit moved higher year over year.”
Overall, MSFT ranks 2nd on our list of the best tech stocks to buy for long-term investment. While we acknowledge the growth potential of MSFT, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than MSFT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

The major U.S. stock indexes inched higher on Friday, April 11, 2025, as traders cautiously navigated the final trading session of what has been one of the most volatile weeks in recent market history. The S&P 500 added 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered near the flatline, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4%.
This modest recovery comes after Thursday’s steep selloff when the Dow tumbled over 1,000 points (2.5%), the S&P 500 fell 3.46%, and the Nasdaq plunged 4.31%. Despite Friday’s gains, the major indexes remain well below their levels before President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on April 2.
Weekly Performance:– Dow Jones: +3.3% for the week– S&P 500: +3.8% for the week– Nasdaq Composite: +5.1% for the week
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” has retreated from its midweek spike above 50 but remains elevated near 44, reflecting continued uncertainty in the markets.
Market volatility has been primarily driven by the rapidly evolving trade situation. After Wednesday’s historic rally following Trump’s announcement of a 90-day pause on many “reciprocal” tariffs, markets tumbled Thursday when the White House clarified that goods from China would still face a staggering 145% tariff rate.
China retaliated on Friday by raising its levies on U.S. products to 125% from 84%, with the Chinese finance ministry stating, “Even if the U.S. continues to impose higher tariffs, it will no longer make economic sense and will become a joke in the history of world economy.”
Meanwhile, the European Union has paused its retaliatory tariffs and announced its trade representative will fly to Washington on Sunday to “try and sign deals” during the 90-day reprieve period.
The first-quarter earnings season officially began with major banks reporting results that offered insights into the economic impact of recent trade tensions:
– JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shares rose over 2% after reporting better-than-expected Q1 earnings of $5.07 per share on revenue of $46.01 billion, driven by record equities trading amid market volatility. CEO Jamie Dimon maintained a cautious tone, noting that “clients have become more cautious amid an increase in market volatility driven by geopolitical and trade-related tensions.”
– Wells Fargo (WFC) shares rose about 1% in early trading despite reporting a 6% year-over-year decline in net interest income to $11.50 billion. CEO Charlie Scharf highlighted economic uncertainty, stating, “We support the administration’s willingness to look at barriers to fair trade for the United States, though there are certainly risks associated with such significant actions.”
– Morgan Stanley (MS) gained more than 1% after reporting Q1 net revenue of $17.7 billion, exceeding analyst expectations of $16.56 billion.
The “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks showed mixed performance on Friday, with most posting modest gains that helped support the broader market:
– Nvidia (NVDA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) led the group with gains exceeding 2%– Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) each rose more than 1%– Amazon (AMZN) edged up 0.24%
However, U.S. chip manufacturers faced significant pressure after the China Semiconductor Association announced that chip tariffs will be based on where they are manufactured rather than shipped from. Texas Instruments (TXN) plunged more than 9%, while Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Intel (INTC) dropped more than 7%.
Investors should keep an eye on these key events in the coming weeks:
1. European Central Bank Meeting (April 17): Markets are pricing in a 95% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut.
2. Tech Earnings: Major tech companies reporting in the next two weeks include:   – Netflix (NFLX): April 17   – Tesla (TSLA): April 22   – Alphabet (GOOGL): April 25   – Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META): April 30
3. Economic Data: Upcoming releases will be closely watched for signs of inflation driven by tariffs and potential economic slowdown.
Despite Friday’s modest gains, market sentiment remains cautious as investors assess the economic impact of escalating trade tensions. JPMorgan economists have reduced their estimate of a U.S. and global recession this year to 50%, down from 60% earlier this month.
Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari made hawkish comments today, reiterating that “the potential inflationary impact of tariffs makes the Fed less likely to lower interest rates, even in the face of a weakening economy.”
As earnings season accelerates in the coming weeks, with over 55% of S&P 500 companies reporting between April 21 and May 2, investors will be closely monitoring corporate guidance for insights into how businesses are navigating the uncertain trade environment.
The dollar index weakened 1% on Friday, putting it on track to end the week down by 3%, while safe-haven assets like gold reached new all-time highs, reflecting ongoing concerns about economic stability.
As we move forward, market participants will be watching closely for any developments in trade negotiations and signs of economic impact from the tariff policies that have dominated market sentiment throughout this turbulent week.

U.S. stock markets are showing signs of recovery on Friday, April 11, 2025, following a tumultuous week dominated by trade war concerns. As of midday trading, the major indexes have managed to regain some ground after Thursday’s steep selloff. The Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 0.44% at 39,971.00, S&P 500 futures rose 0.55% to 5,331.00, and Nasdaq Composite futures advanced 0.60% to 18,595.50.
This modest recovery comes after a dramatic week that saw the Dow plunge 1,015 points (2.5%) on Thursday, while the S&P 500 fell 3.46% and the Nasdaq slid 4.31%. Thursday’s losses followed Wednesday’s historic rally, which was one of the best days for stocks in modern history.
The primary driver behind this week’s extreme market volatility has been the escalating trade tensions between the United States and China. On Friday morning, China announced it would raise additional tariffs on U.S. goods from 84% to 125%, effective April 12, in direct response to President Trump’s tariff policies.
This move follows Thursday’s clarification from the White House that the total levies on China stand at 145%, a level economists warn could severely impact U.S.-China trade. While President Trump paused most of his “reciprocal” tariffs for 90 days earlier this week, the universal 10% tariff that went into effect last Saturday remains in place, along with 25% tariffs on auto imports, steel, and aluminum.
Despite the temporary pause on some tariffs, economists remain concerned about the economic damage already inflicted, with many still forecasting an elevated risk of a U.S. and global recession. JPMorgan maintains its 60% recession probability forecast even after Trump’s partial detente.
The technology sector, which has been particularly vulnerable to trade war concerns due to global supply chain dependencies, is showing mixed performance today. After significant losses on Thursday, some tech giants are staging a modest comeback:
– Apple (AAPL) is gaining ground today after falling 4.24% on Thursday. The company has been particularly sensitive to China tariff news given its extensive manufacturing presence there.
– Microsoft (MSFT) is also up slightly after dropping 2.3% in the previous session.
– Nvidia (NVDA) has risen approximately 1.5% today, attempting to recover from Thursday’s 5.91% decline.
– Tesla (TSLA) continues to struggle, down more than 1% today after a 7.27% drop on Thursday. Analysts have slashed price targets for the EV maker due to concerns about Trump’s impending tariffs on auto parts and weakening demand in Europe and China.
Other notable tech movements include Broadcom (AVGO) up 2.5%, while Texas Instruments (TXN) has slid 8% to lead S&P 500 decliners. On Semiconductor (ON) declined 7%, and Intel (INTC) fell about 6%.
The first-quarter earnings season has officially begun, with major banks reporting results today. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon warned in his annual letter to shareholders that he expected the Trump administration’s tariffs “will slow down growth.”
“The economy is facing considerable turbulence (including geopolitics), with the potential positives of tax reform and deregulation and the potential negatives of tariffs and ‘trade wars,’ ongoing sticky inflation, high fiscal deficits and still rather high asset prices and volatility,” Dimon stated.
Wells Fargo (WFC) and Morgan Stanley (MS) also reported today, with Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) scheduled to release their results next week. Analysts had noted that while tariffs may not directly affect banks, they will likely impact their customers.
Gold continues its impressive run, with futures up 1.65% to $3,229.90 per ounce, trading at record high levels. Mining companies are benefiting from this surge, with Barrick Gold (GOLD) and Newmont Mining (NEM) each gaining more than 6%.
Oil prices have stabilized, with West Texas Intermediate futures holding steady at around $60.10 per barrel. This represents a recovery from Wednesday’s four-year low of approximately $55, which was driven by concerns about slowing global demand.
In the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin is trading at $82,200, up from an overnight low of $78,900, continuing to track movements in the equities market.
Investors should keep an eye on several important economic events scheduled for next week:
– The European Union will hold an interest rate decision on Thursday, April 17, which could impact global markets.
– U.S. economic data releases next week include Building Permits and the Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index on Thursday, April 17.
– Friday, April 18, will see bank holidays in several countries, including Australia, Switzerland, the UK, Canada, and Germany, which may affect trading volumes.
As earnings season continues to ramp up, analysts at FactSet estimate a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 7.3% for S&P 500 companies, which would mark the seventh straight quarter of earnings growth.
As we close out this volatile trading week, market sentiment remains cautious but slightly optimistic. The CBOE Volatility Index, often referred to as Wall Street’s fear gauge, surged 40% on Thursday and briefly traded above 50 points midday—a rare level associated with extreme volatility.
While today’s modest gains offer some relief, investors remain wary about the economic effects of the U.S.-China trade war and its potential impact on global financial markets. The European Union has stated it will use the 90-day pause in U.S. tariffs to find an alternative solution with President Trump, describing the hiatus as a “window of opportunity.”
For investors navigating these uncertain waters, diversification and careful monitoring of trade developments will be crucial in the weeks ahead as markets continue to digest the implications of these significant policy shifts.
