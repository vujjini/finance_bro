It's been a wild week for semiconductor stocks. And for good reason, as tariffs throw a wrench into global supply chains and capital spending, thereby affecting demand for chips.
One of the largest semiconductor exchange-traded funds (ETFs) by net assets is the iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ: SOXX). The fund surged 19% on Wednesday, fueled by huge gains in top holdings like Nvidia and Broadcom, as the market skyrocketed in hopes that trade tensions could ease.
Here's why the ETF stands out as a solid buy for folks looking for chip companies to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) and growing global connectivity.
The iShares Semiconductor ETF is a textbook example of why a fund can hold dozens of stocks but still be highly volatile if it is tied to one theme.
As mentioned, the fund surged on Wednesday. Before that, it fell 4% on Tuesday; was up 2% on Monday, fell 7.5% on April 2; and dropped 10% on April 3. When the dust had settled, the fund was down 3% in those five days, showcasing the extent of the sell-off in chip stocks before Wednesday's monster rally.
When equity prices are swinging this wildly to the upside and the downside, it can be difficult to stay on an even keel. But maintaining a long-term outlook is the best way to approach the semiconductor industry and the iShares Semiconductor ETF.
The fund gives investors exposure to different aspects of the chip industry. Nvidia is the undisputed leader in making graphics processing units (GPUs) for AI applications.
Broadcom makes accelerator chips, or application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that are built for AI tasks. The company also has a growing software-as-a-service platform through its acquisition of VMware, as well as an established network connectivity hardware division.
The third-largest holding in the fund, Texas Instruments, is an established player in analog and embedded chips mainly used for the industrial and automotive sectors.
Qualcomm is the fourth-largest holding in the fund, with a 6.8% weighting. The company is a leader in smartphone chip manufacturing, and its processors power Samsung's generative-AI-enabled Galaxy smartphones.
Advanced Micro Devices is the fifth-largest holding. It has an entrenched position in central processing units but is trying to grow its market share in GPUs for data centers that compete with Nvidia. AMD has been relatively unsuccessful so far, a testament to Nvidia's lead over the competition.
All told, the top five holdings make up 38% of the fund. With 30 total holdings, it is well diversified across the chip industry. It's a solid way to get exposure to chip designers, manufacturers, components and equipment suppliers, and other parts of the semiconductor industry.
Even after Wednesday's surge, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is down 15% year to date (YTD) at the time of this writing. Nvidia is down 15% YTD, and Broadcom is still down slightly over 20%.
When markets are volatile, the best way to approach a potential investment is to zoom out and build an investment thesis for why a stock or ETF could be worth holding for at least three to five years. The simplest reason to buy the iShares Semiconductor ETF is for a catchall way to invest in AI.
Companies like Nvidia and Broadcom don't mind if Microsoft or Alphabet take market share from Amazon Web Services, as long as data center demand continues to grow. The iShares Semiconductor ETF takes that same idea a step further by owning leaders across the industry so that investors benefit from overall growth even if, for example, AMD eventually takes some market share from Nvidia, or hyperscalers find more value from Broadcom's ASICs for certain applications than Nvidia's GPUs.
Before buying the iShares Semiconductor ETF, it's important to recognize that the fund is highly volatile, so it should only be approached if you have a high risk tolerance and long-term time horizon. It's also worth scanning the list of holdings in the fund to see if you would end up with duplicate holdings. For example, suppose you already own Nvidia and are comfortable with your position. In that case, the fund may not be the best buy, considering it would give you even more exposure to Nvidia.
With a 0.35% expense ratio, the fund doesn't have as low a fee structure as you'll find from larger, passively managed funds. But the iShares Semiconductor ETF is still a good starting point for investors looking for a plug-and-play way to boost their semiconductor exposure.

Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), an icon in the world of artificial intelligence (AI), has generated huge wealth for its long-term shareholders. In just the last five years, its shares have surged 1,610% (as of April 9), driven by ridiculous demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs). This trend shows no sign of slowing down. 
However, things haven't been so smooth for its investors over the past few months. At the time of this writing, the AI stock is trading about 24% off the all-time high it hit in January amid a volatile market sell-off. But when pessimism and fear are in the air, some stocks can become oversold. Could that be the case here? Is Nvidia a no-brainer buying opportunity right now?
Training and powering all the AI models that have hit the market requires advanced computing solutions. Nvidia sells the GPUs that provide just the sort of high-speed computational power those applications demand. In its fiscal 2025 fourth quarter, which ended Jan. 26, 91% of its revenue came from the data center segment, which is experiencing a massive surge in demand. Nvidia has taken a commanding lead in the AI chip segment, where it holds the vast majority of the market.
Nvidia's growth trajectory will probably be the subject of numerous business school case studies in the future. Its revenue increased 78% from $22.1 billion in its fiscal 2024 Q4 to $39.3 billion in its most recently ended fiscal quarter. This was supported by cloud infrastructure providers that are boosting their AI capabilities to better serve their customers. Nvidia's revenue in its fiscal 2025 was 12-fold higher than just five years before.
If you think Nvidia's top-line growth is impressive, look further down the income statement. This insanely profitable company's net income in the fourth quarter was 56% of sales. The operating leverage inherent in this business model is clear.
A company doesn't reach a $2.4 trillion market cap without doing some things right. There are important factors that position Nvidia well in its industry.
The first is its ability to innovate. Nvidia has historically introduced new GPU architectures at a rapid pace. Before it debuted its current cutting-edge Blackwell architecture, its Hopper and Lovelace lines were the best-in-class offerings of their periods, catering to the needs of customers and providing tangible improvement upon previous GPU generations. 
Nvidia has also developed a wide and multifaceted economic moat. One factor in its economic advantage is its unmatched technological know-how in terms of GPU design, in addition to the tools needed for developers to use this hardware. This has given it a huge lead in the industry.
Another area of competitive strength comes from its CUDA software platform -- a computing platform and application programming interface that allows developers to get the most speed and power out of its GPUs, and make it easier for AI experts to develop models. The result is that Nvidia also benefits from switching costs. CUDA only works with Nvidia's hardware. Developers who become expert in programming on that proprietary platform will be less likely to want to buy competitors' chips.
Apple has become arguably the world's most successful company because it has developed a beautiful balance between its hardware and software offerings. Nvidia is doing something similar.
Despite these positive characteristics, Nvidia still faces some noteworthy financial risks. Top hyperscaler clients like Amazon and Alphabet are working on their own AI accelerator chips. 
What's more, it's easy to imagine that Nvidia's revenue could take a severe hit in an economic downturn. A substantial amount of money is being spent on AI. Some of these capital outlays will likely be delayed or canceled in a recession.
President Donald Trump's ongoing tariff announcements and threats have sent shock waves through the global financial markets. Tech stocks have taken some of the biggest hits. The "Magnificent Seven" are all trading well off their peaks. It looks like the narrative of the AI boom is looking less compelling in the face of broader macroeconomic concerns.
Yet Nvidia's valuation might be too tempting to ignore. The stock trades right now at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 25. It has rarely been close to that cheap in the past couple of years. It can be mentally challenging to buy shares in AI companies when macro conditions are so volatile and uncertain. However, increasing your portfolio's exposure to the AI trend by opening a small position in the leading GPU provider now makes sense.

This has been a brutal year for the U.S. tech industry as a combination of challenges, ranging from political uncertainty to foreign competition, has shaken some of its core assumptions. Globalism is no longer guaranteed, and developing markets like China are transitioning from a source of low-cost labor into a viable threat to U.S. technological dominance. 
The next 12 months could be a make-or-break period for Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) as it navigates the evolving macroeconomic landscape. Let's dig deeper to decide how the company's shares might perform.
While it is too early to be sure, President Donald Trump's April 2 tariff announcement may mark the beginning of the end for globalization -- a system that facilitated increasingly complex international supply chains. Nvidia is a typical example of how globalized business models work. 
As a fabless semiconductor company, Nvidia only designs its chips. Their actual production is outsourced to foreign companies like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC), which produces them with the help of EUV machines from the Dutch company ASML. 
These international interdependencies could draw unwelcome political attention. But the good news is that Nvidia worked to preempt this exposure with the help of its manufacturing partners. 
In late 2024, TSMC opened its first U.S. factory in Arizona, allowing Nvidia to source its cutting-edge Blackwell AI chips domestically. This move could shield the company from potential tariffs, which is essential for its long-term success. Even though semiconductors are currently exempt from this latest round of tariffs, their strategic nature will likely attract attention from this administration and future U.S. lawmakers, so it is advantageous for Nvidia to get ahead of this potential headwind. 
Although trade war talk is stealing the show in April, Nvidia's stock price crash started in January, with the launch of the high-performing Chinese large language model (LLM) DeepSeek V3, which was allegedly developed for just $6 million. While the actual cost is still hotly debated, it is believed that V3 was built using much less advanced H800 chips while still comparing favorably to American LLMs like OpenAI's ChatGPT, which were built with substantially more expensive hardware.
DeepSeek calls into question the amount of money American AI companies are spending on Nvidia hardware. And while major customers like Meta Platforms continue to plow money into the opportunity, it may be a matter of time before they face shareholder backlash over the amount being spent for minimal financial reward. 
In April, an Indian start-up called Ziroh Labs added even more uncertainty to the U.S. AI market with the release of Kompact AI, a system designed to run LLMs without advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) made by companies like Nvidia. Inference (the process where an AI model uses its trained knowledge to generate output) represents a significant source of demand for Nvidia's hardware. Kompact AI aims to facilitate this process using less expensive central processing units (CPUs), which are widely available on consumer devices like laptops and computers.
Over the next 12 months, Nvidia should face substantial volatility. Even though the company seems relatively isolated from the direct impacts of the trade war, that isn't stopping investors from jumping ship. Low-cost competition from China and India is also beginning to call into question the importance of its most advanced (and expensive) GPUs for training and running competitive LLMs. 
With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 25, Nvidia's current valuation is relatively low for a company that grew fourth-quarter profits by 80% year over year. This discount already prices in much of the uncertainty. However, investors may want to wait for the stock to fall deeper into oversold territory before considering a position. 
The events of early April have made this a fear and uncertainty-driven market. And until that changes, fundamentals may take the back seat.

The ever-growing U.S. tariffs on imports from China won’t bite Big Tech so badly after all, after the Trump administration late Friday laid out significant exemptions from its wider trade war that include smartphones, laptop computers, chips, and more.
The exemptions, published by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, amount to a huge break for tech giants such as Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT), and for the broader tech industry, even as uncertainty persists over the direction of President Donald Trump’s trade war. It means some of the most crucial and high-end technology imports — which overwhelmingly aren’t made in the U.S. — won’t be subject to Trump’s 125% tariff on China, or his baseline 10% tariff on almost every other country.
A Wall Street analyst quickly called it “the best news possible for tech investors.”
“The U.S. tech industry has a loud voice and despite initial strong pushback against exemptions within the White House, the reality of the situation was finally recognized in the Beltway,” Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note Saturday. “There is still clear uncertainty and volatility ahead with these China negotiations. Big Tech firms like Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and the broader tech industry can breathe a huge sigh of relief this weekend into Monday.”
The exemptions follow a pattern from Trump’s first term, when Apple in particular saw significant success in lobbying Trump for trade war carveouts. Making products such as the iPhone in America would be almost economically impossible. Wedbush had warned earlier this month that Apple faced a “complete disaster” from the China tariffs.
And the Trump administration’s move came as its trade war has driven days of volatility in financial markets, as well as cratering consumer confidence and growing recession fears.
Ives called the exemptions “a big step forward for U.S. tech to get these exemptions and the most bullish news we could have heard this weekend. ... Big Tech is back off the cliff with these exemptions and this changes the entire situation for tech stocks with this black swan event for the industry removed.”

We recently published a list of 12 Best Tech Stocks to Buy For Long-Term Investment. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other tech stocks to buy for long-term investment.
On April 1, Chris Verrone, chief market strategist at Strategas Research Partners, appeared on CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ to talk about his outlook on the tech sector. Verrone believes that most of the current market’s negative sentiment has already been factored into recent stock prices. He highlighted that even after the market’s decline, the VIX, and the currency and bond volatility are lower than they were during the mid-March stress period. Plus, fewer stocks are hitting new lows. He thinks that market lows are formed during periods of bad news, and the market will rally from its current level with an anticipated range of 5,900 to 5,950.
Verrone believes that the current downturn is more than a typical 10% correction so it will take some time to figure out the market’s true direction. He emphasized the importance of monitoring market breadth, new highs, and credit conditions in the upcoming weeks and months. He also acknowledged the shift in investor sentiment, with more bears than bulls. As the conversation touched on the impact of the Fed and politics in a market, Verrone stated that he pays more attention to what the 2-year Treasury yield tells him instead of listening to what Fed officials have to say. He noted that the 2-year yield’s decline from 3.83% to 3.85% suggests a shift in the market expectations for the Fed’s actions. He highlighted the resilience of financials during the correction and contrasted it with the weakness of tech. He thinks that, unlike financials that entered the correction as leaders, the tech sector might not be able to regain the leadership role.
While Verrone’s stance acknowledges the current weakness in tech, it’s important to note that the tech sector remains one of the more innovative markets in the long run. For instance, MAG7 continues to be a driving force for this market.
We first sifted through financial media reports to compile a list of the top tech stocks that are being touted as long term investment plays. We then selected the 12 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q4 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey’s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a computing infrastructure company. Its Compute & Networking segment comprises Data Center computing platforms and end-to-end networking platforms. The Graphics segment offers various GPUs for gaming, PCs, enterprise workstation graphics, cloud-based visual & virtual computing, infotainment systems, and others.
The company’s Data Center segment generated a record $35.6 billion in FQ4 2025 revenue which marked a 93% year-over-year rise. For the entire FY25, the revenue doubled as compared to the year-ago period due to the surging demand for AI infrastructure. The adoption of the company’s Blackwell architecture drove this growth. In FQ4 alone, Blackwell’s sales reached $11 billion and marked the fastest product ramp in the company’s history. It delivers up to 25x higher token throughput and 20x lower cost than the Hopper 100 for reasoning AI.
On March 28, Bank of America reiterated a Buy rating with a $200 price target for the company due to its optimism about NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) despite the new US AI Diffusion Rules that impact AI chip distribution. Large cloud service providers (CSPs) like Azure, GCP, AWS, and OCI are deploying Blackwell systems to meet the growing demand for AI infrastructure. Consumer internet companies such as Meta are using its GPUs for GenAI and deep learning applications.
Guinness Global Innovators is highly bullish on NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) due to its dominant AI chip market position. It stated the following in its Q4 2024 investor letter:
“For a second year running, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the Fund’s top performing stock, delivering a stellar return of +177.7% over the year. Since the beginning of last year, Nvidia’s ‘Hopper’ GPUs have been at the centre of exploding demand for chips powerful and efficient enough to facilitate the energy intensive requirements of AI processes within datacentres. Initially possessing over 95% of market share in these types of chips, Nvidia have been quick to entrench their position as the technological leader in the space, launching the successor to the current ‘Hopper’ GPU in March, Blackwell, inhibiting the likes of AMD and Intel making meaningful inroads in taking share of the fast-growing market. Compared to the previous iteration (Hopper) which is continuing to fuel Nvidia’s extreme revenue growth, the Blackwell chip is twice as powerful for training AI models and has 5 times the capability when it comes to “inference” (the speed at which AI models respond to queries). Throughout the year, Nvidia’s financial performance has remained resilient. Quarterly revenues hit $35.1 billion in their most recent quarter, beating consensus expectations by 6% and representing a +94% year-over-year increase. Additionally, Nvidia’s data centre segment, driven by the Hopper (H100) chip, grew fivefold over the past year, underscoring the sustained demand for advanced AI infrastructure. The H100 chip, priced at around $40,000, continues to see significant adoption due to its ability to enhance AI model training efficiency while lowering overall costs. This growth is expected to continue as companies invest in upgrading existing data centres and building new ones, with Nvidia well-positioned to capture a significant share of the estimated $2 trillion market opportunity over the next five years. There have been some concerns over Blackwell production delays causing share price volatility however, Nvidia has recovered swiftly, driven by positive earnings results through the year and assurances from management regarding future supply. Additionally, the release of the H200 chip promises to extend Nvidia’s technological leadership, ensuring continued momentum into 2025. While Nvidia’s valuation remains a topic of debate, the stock is not at a significant premium to history, and it still appears reasonable given its dominant market position, innovative prowess, and exposure to long-term secular growth trends in AI, cloud computing, and data infrastructure. As a result, Nvidia remains well-positioned to deliver sustained outperformance over the long term, making it a cornerstone of growth-oriented portfolios.”
Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best tech stocks to buy for long-term investment. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

We recently published a list of 14 AI Stocks Catching Wall Street’s Attention. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks catching Wall Street’s attention.
In the latest development in the feud between OpenAI and Elon Musk, the ChatGPT maker has countersued billionaire Musk, citing a pattern of harassment. The company also asked a federal judge to stop Musk from any “further unlawful and unfair action” against OpenAI in a court case over the company’s future structure that has fueled the AI revolution.
OpenAI claims that Musk has tried “nonstop” to slow down its business for his benefit, accusing him of using “bad-faith tactics” against it to help him control AI technology.
Musk has been actively seeking to stop OpenAI from transitioning to a “for-profit” company, claiming that the transition will be a bad idea, which prioritizes commercial interests and compromises its mission of benefiting humanity.
OpenAI, however, denies these allegations. The company must complete its transition by the end of the year if it seeks to secure the entire $40 billion of its current fundraising round. If the transition fails to complete by year-end, the funding will likely be reduced to US$20 billion.

“Through press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk’s more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims, and a sham bid for OpenAI’s assets, Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI,”
In response, Musk’s legal team has referred to a $97.4 billion unsolicited takeover bid from a Musk-led consortium. This bid was rejected by OpenAI.
“Had OpenAI’s Board genuinely considered the bid as they were obligated to do they would have seen how serious it was. It’s telling that having to pay fair market value for OpenAI’s assets allegedly ‘interferes’ with their business plans.”

Investing.com -- Analysts continue to expect meaningful restrictions on Nvidia’s H20 chip in China, despite a recent media report suggesting the U.S. Commerce Department may allow shipments to proceed.
The H20, a performance-limited version of Nvidia’s flagship H100 GPU, was designed to comply with U.S. export controls by staying below a specific teraflop-per-square-millimeter performance threshold. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has described the H20 as addressing "a very competitive space," but Morgan Stanley noted its performance is roughly 75% below that of the H100, which was barred from export to China last year.
When you force the best AI hardware company in the world to compete at what is now 85% or more below the state of the art performance level, pricing will be competitive,” analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote. They estimate gross margins on the H20 are in the 50% range, well below Nvidia’s corporate average in the 70s, and said H20 strength contributed to weaker gross margins over the past two quarters.
A report on NPR.com suggested that although H20 was initially targeted for restriction, the U.S. government may now allow continued shipments. Morgan Stanley said the report "has not been confirmed" and maintained that restrictions remain its base case.
Morgan Stanley pointed to U.S. export bans on high-end chips, which would drive Chinese firms not buy the H20, while newer Blackwell GPUs offer as much as 25 times the performance,That leaves Chinese companies with limited choices: using GPUs in foreign cloud platforms (where permitted), sourcing restricted chips through secondary markets (which is not allowed), or buying compliant chips like the H20 or AMD’s MI308.
The analysts said the public cloud is not a viable solution for all Chinese users and that back-channel procurement of high-end chips is likely overestimated, due to legal and financial risks. Which leaves companies with option 3, analyst say. And while buying performance that far behind the state of the art isn’t optimal, it’s the only option available, and companies have shown good results.

We recently published a list of 30 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The optimism around the United States economy over the past few months, largely due to the AI hype, has been dampened by recent measures undertaken by the Trump administration to shore up US manufacturing. These measures, largely in the form of obscene tariffs on goods imported into the US from overseas, with a particular focus on China, have hit global stocks, resulting in a downward spiral for major indexes. The latest tariff hike has wiped trillions in market capitalization from the Magnificent Seven, a group of seven firms that dominate the benchmark US indexes and are heavily invested in AI. Latest reports from market research firm IDC indicate that if the tariffs stay in place, they are expected to trigger supply chain disruptions and inflationary challenges across various markets, including the IT sector. According to a report from news agency Reuters, global hedge funds, dominated by billionaires, scaled back their risky bets and sought safety before Trump introduced new tariffs last week.
This report was based on data gathered by investment bank Goldman Sachs. Per the data, hedge funds pulled out of bets in emerging markets of Europe and Asia ahead of the announcement of new tariffs. Research by investment bank Morgan Stanley, as seen by Reuters, also echoes these sentiments. Morgan Stanley estimates US long-short funds net leverage quickly fell to 37%, just shy of historical lows, by the end of last week, from over 50% at the beginning of the year. Net leverage measures the difference between a fund’s long and short positions against the value of what it owns including borrowings. JPMorgan also noted in a recent report that the net leverage of hedge funds has dropped to around the lowest since late 2023. The lower the net leverage, the more conservative a hedge fund’s position. Investors expect significant volatility on risk assets in the near term given the tariff uncertainties and suggest a continued risk-off stance.

The latest developments represent a reversal of positions from billionaires who, in the past few months, have often hailed AI as the next transformative technology that would shape the future of economies, industries, and society. Influential billionaires repeatedly advocated for investing heavily in AI for the immense economic value it promised. This bullish thesis was based on research from firms like McKinsey that predicted that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy in the coming years. For investors, this translated into a chance to own stakes in technologies that could underpin the next generation of global growth. For billionaire investors, AI also represented both a diversification strategy and a chance to influence the direction of a powerful new technology. These investors often take strategic stakes that allow them to shape product development and scaling. Some of the biggest companies these investors made huge bets on are discussed in detail below.

For this article, we consulted an internal database on AI companies. From these, we selected the thirty stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. As US President Trump weighs further tariffs on products coming into the US from trade rivals like China, a Financial Times report has quoted Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA, as saying that his firm will spend hundreds of billions of dollars on chips and other electronics manufactured in the US over the next four years. The announcement follows multibillion-dollar US investment plans announced by other technology companies, including Apple. Huang added that the leading artificial intelligence chipmaker was now able to manufacture its latest systems in the US through suppliers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Foxconn, and that he saw a growing competitive threat from Huawei in China.
Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of these AI companies, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about this cheapest AI stock.

Oops, something went wrong
Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. 
Shares of semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) surged 18.7% on April 9, after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on the higher "reciprocal tariffs." Instead, he has authorized a "lowered reciprocal tariff of 10%" -- in line with the 10% baseline tariff set on all imports.
Investors had long been worried about the U.S. government's decision to impose import tariffs on products from various trading partners. Since this can lead to rising costs, disruptions in the supply chain, and retaliatory tariffs on American goods, many U.S. stocks saw a dramatic decline in early April 2025. The temporary pause in reciprocal tariffs seems well received by Wall Street.
Nvidia's stock is down nearly 25% from its recent high in January 2025. Although this is not a very encouraging sign, it is a solid improvement from the almost 38% drawdown from the high on April 4.
So, does valuation correction present an opportunity for investors to buy, hold, or sell Nvidia stock now? Let's find out.
Regulatory risks have emerged as a primary headwind for Nvidia. In April 2025, the U.S. government announced its decision to levy a hefty 32% tariff on imports from Taiwan and a 34% tariff from China. China responded by levying 84% retaliatory tariffs on imports from the U.S. In retaliation, the U.S. government has increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 104%.
Although semiconductors have been excluded from this round of tariffs, there are signals of a potential escalation of trade wars between the U.S. and China.
Jefferies analysts fear the possibility of additional sector-specific tariffs, including semiconductors, in subsequent tariff rounds. If true, it can lead to significant supply chain disruptions and margin pressures for Nvidia, considering that the company depends heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's fabs for chip manufacturing.
The U.S. government has long been mulling stricter controls on chip sales to China. The Chinese government's recently introduced energy-efficiency guidelines, also urge companies to use chips adhering to strict requirements in new data centers or expansions. Since Nvidia's best-selling H20 chip does not fulfil these requirements, it may hurt the company's Chinese business -- accounting for almost 13% of its revenues in fiscal 2025 (ending Jan. 26).
Nvidia is also encountering competitive pressures, though other chip manufacturers are significantly behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. The company is also experiencing short-term gross margin pressures due to the ongoing ramp-up of its Blackwell systems.
Despite these challenges, multiple catalysts can drive up Nvidia's share prices in the coming months.
Nvidia enjoys an unmatched technological edge in AI computing, which is evident considering its over 90% share in the AI GPU market. The company has developed a robust AI infrastructure optimized for several AI computational workloads with significant growth opportunities. These include pre-training scaling or building and upgrading foundational models with large amounts of multimodal data, post-training scaling or customizing and fine-tuning foundational models, and inferencing, including complex reasoning.
The recently launched Blackwell architecture systems have been specially architected for inference workloads (deploying and running models in a real-time environment) across various deployment environments such as on-premises, cloud, or hybrid. Blackwell is also optimized for computation-heavy reasoning inference workloads, demonstrating 25 times higher token throughput and 20 times lower cost than the Hopper 100 chips. Hence, with enterprise demand increasingly shifting from training workloads to more recurring inference workloads, Blackwell is expected to continue to be a significant growth catalyst for Nvidia.
Besides hardware, Nvidia has built a solid software ecosystem with over 5.9 million developers using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and other software platforms. The company has also recently introduced software offerings such as Nvidia AI Enterprise and Nvidia Inference Microservices to enable enterprises to deploy AI solutions effectively. This software advantage has led to high switching costs, which has resulted in a sticky customer base.
Finally, the rapid adoption of AI agents and robotics is also proving to be a significant growth avenue for Nvidia. Blackwell chips are well poised to benefit from the evolving agentic AI opportunity, as it has the computational power and low latency required for building systems capable of making complex decisions and planning.
Nvidia is trading at 24.45 times forward earnings, far lower than its five-year average of 71.54x. Hence, it is evident that most of the risks are already priced at the company's share price.
But Nvidia also has a history of rebounding significantly after deep falls. Some of the recent events can better highlight this trend.
This was seen in 2018, when the stock crashed over 53% from its peak in early October 2018 to its low in late December 2018. The decline was mainly due to the crypto market crash amid the global tech sell-off, resulting in excess inventory buildup for Nvidia. However, the stock recovered by over 65% in 2019, after inventory levels normalized and sales in gaming and data center segments started showing strong momentum.
Nvidia stock also crashed by 30% from its recent peak in February 2020 to its low in March 2020 due to marketwide uncertainty and supply chain disruptions in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, by March 2021, the stock had soared over 100%, driven mainly by increased demand for gaming and data center services during the pandemic.
Finally, Nvidia stock crashed almost 66% from November 2021 to mid-October 2022, due to concerns about rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions. But then, the stock had recovered over 200% by October 2023, fueled by explosive demand in AI and data center markets and the company's focus on product innovation.
Hence, historically, Nvidia has returned even stronger within 12 months after a significant stock decline. Therefore, it makes sense for retail investors to acquire at least a small stake in this stock to benefit from its future growth prospects.
Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:

The wild week is finally over for technology and the broader market.
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumped 7% this week for its best week since 2022 as investors reckoned with market turbulence spurred by tariff uncertainty. Between Tuesday and Thursday, the Nasdaq fell more than 2%, then soared 12%, before dropping over 4% and finishing the week with a 2% rally.
Megacap technology stocks also capped off a winning week, led by Nvidia. The chipmaking giant surged more than 17% for its best week since August, while Amazon popped more than 8%. Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta Platforms all jumped nearly 8%. Tesla, which had its best session since 2013 added more than 5%. Apple, also gained 5% and recorded its best day since 1998 this week.
Stocks are wrapping one of the wildest trading weeks in recent history. Markets climbed Wednesday after Trump announced a 90-day pause on some reciprocal tariffs. The S&P 500 posted its third-largest one-day gain since World War II, while the Nasdaq had its second-best session ever. Major averages reversed course Thursday, giving up some gains as Trump singled out China with higher tariff rates.
The new calendar year has been rocky for technology stocks once responsible for pushing the market to new highs. Many tech leaders also trekked to Washington to support Trump on inauguration day. But all members of the elite "Magnificent Seven" have dropped in market value this year. Tesla has led the declines, shedding more than a third of its value.
Other technology stocks joined in on the week-to-date rally. Palantir skyrocketed nearly 20%, while AppLovin jumped about 14%. Oracle and Salesforce added about 3% and 6%, respectively.
Many semiconductor stocks are also tracking for a positive week. The VanEck Semiconductor ETF rose 11% and had best day ever on Wednesday. Broadcom led the chipmaking gains, soaring 24%. Applied Materials, KLA Corporation and Lam Research rallied at least 14% each. Taiwan Semiconductor, Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm edged up at least 7%.

Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have made NVIDIA Corporation NVDA a Wall Street darling for some time. On the other hand, Broadcom Inc.’s AVGO recent share repurchase plan, along with its planned moves to capitalize on the growing AI field, has delighted income-oriented investors.  
However, the latest trade war between the United States and several other countries has caused market turmoil, with shares of NVIDIA and Broadcom declining 19.9% and 25.7% year to date. This presents an opportunity to buy these quality stocks at a discounted price for long-term gains. But which stock is the better bargain? Let’s explore –  
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
NVIDIA leads the growing graphics processing unit (GPU) market with over 80% share, giving the Jensen Huang-led company a competitive edge over its peers. More than Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s AMD ROCm software platform, NVIDIA’s CUDA software platform is in demand among developers.  
At the same time, there is an insane demand for NVIDIA’s new Blackwell chips among notable tech firms due to their energy efficiency and faster AI interfaces. The older Hopper chips also maintain steady demand due to their higher quality compared to rival Intel Corporation’s INTC chips (read more: Can Intel Be the Turnaround Stock of 2025? Is the Time to Buy Now?).
NVIDIA, meanwhile, is well-poised to make the most of the increase in AI data center spending. Top cloud computing stocks are fulfilling the increase in demand for AI workloads by acquiring GPUs and are spending $250 billion on AI data center infrastructure. One of NVIDIA’s prominent customers, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, may have reduced data center spending, but Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN are now supporting NVIDIA in this aspect. 
Broadcom expects the demand for its custom AI accelerator to increase in the near future and the market size for its execution processing units (XPUs) to touch $60-90 billion by fiscal 2027, way higher than last year’s $12.2 billion. 
Broadcom’s XPUs can work on a particular workload and even outdo NVIDIA’s GPUs. Moreover, they have the competence to perform tasks more affordably than GPUs. Thus, banking on the rise in demand for accelerator chips, Broadcom is now developing a 2-nanometer AI XPU, which is unique. The company’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), known to support AI and machine learning, are witnessing strong demand as well. 
No doubt, with GPUs and XPUs gaining popularity in the coming years, and AI infrastructure spending increasing, the future does look bright for both NVIDIA and Broadcom. However, from a long-term perspective, NVIDIA is a better choice than Broadcom.  
This is because NVIDIA has been able to generate profits more proficiently than Broadcom, with its net profit margin coming in at 55.9%, more than AVGO’s 18.5%.  
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
NVIDIA has also been able to control its expenditures and generate profits in a much better way than Broadcom since its return on equity (ROE) of 117.6% outshined AVGO’s 38.5%. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
But from a short-term viewpoint, Broadcom has an upper hand over NVIDIA. After all, Broadcom is a solid dividend payer, which is indicative of a better-quality business that can keep the company immune to the current market vagaries. 
Broadcom has increased its dividends 6 times over the past five years, and its payout ratio sits at a healthy 52% of earnings. Broadcom also has sufficient cash balance to pay off its dividends. Check Broadcom’s dividend history here. 
On the contrary, NVIDIA’s payout ratio sits at a paltry 1% of earnings and the company increased dividends only once in the past five years. Check NVIDIA’s dividend history here. 
NVIDIA presently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), whereas Broadcom carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.

	From thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.

	This company targets millennial and Gen Z audiences, generating nearly $1 billion in revenue last quarter alone. A recent pullback makes now an ideal time to jump aboard. Of course, all our elite picks aren’t winners but this one could far surpass earlier Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Nano-X Imaging which shot up +129.6% in little more than 9 months.

You often hear the word "reset" when analysts come on television to describe what's happening now. That's genuine Wall Street gibberish and, as you know, I don't like that language. I translate it on the spot. A reset really means something bad is happening that has caught us by surprise. We can no longer like the stock or the sector as much as we once did.
Right now, at this very moment, there are so many resets going on that it's awfully hard to nail all of them down, quantify them, and decide what they mean to the portfolio. But let me give you a Main Street edge, one thing that is certain: past performance means nothing in the Trump era of investing. 
That doesn't mean we throw our hands up, give up, and go to cash. This isn't the 2007 financial crisis. It just requires a different mindset and an understanding that there are fewer stocks to like and we have some of those names, along with others that are excommunicated — at least for now.
Friday evening was encouraging. I felt like I had gotten through to the president with regard to the needless punishment of Apple and Nvidia for their associations with China. Not lost on President Donald Trump: Nvidia and Apple are the two most important companies in the stock market today.
Instead of what could have been a doomsday scenario for both companies, but especially Apple, we got a reprieve. The Trump administration issued guidance late Friday that exempted smartphones, computers and other tech products from its reciprocal tariffs. However, there is a reset, judging by the comments Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick made Sunday on ABC's "This Week." The interview was confusing. Lutnick made it sound like we are dealing with a short reprieve, and no more, as companies present a strategy to reshore their products. Nvidia has already made a commitment and is making semis here through construction of fabs by Taiwan Semi. We don't know the gross margins, but they are obviously not as good as those made in Taiwan. 
Apple is a tougher case. The company's shifting of some production to India, the default destination for the iPhone, may not be what the president wants. There are hardliners within the government who want no exemptions. Apple must break ground in the United States to make its products. The impossibility of it all makes me think that Apple goes from "must own" to "never own," which would be a reset to end all resets. But what are we supposed to do? Take a beating in the name of a strategy we have had for years when the election of President Trump heralds a new era where phones are much more expensive and we don't upgrade unless we break our phone? And we buy Apple at our own financial peril? 
The potential saving grace would be if this means phones made in South Korea are also subject to tariffs. If so, Apple could steal more market share from Samsung. Of course, phone companies must continue to subsidize the selection of new phones to encourage switching. Again, that means we have a reprieve but it's going to be a new status quo, and it is one that I find untenable when it comes to investing. I believe it is an imperative to cut back this position tomorrow into any strength.
As is so often with Club, we can't do what you can do. It has been the bane of my charitable trust for more than 20 years and it is one of the reasons why I abhor those who judge how we have done here. I was a successful fund manager, 24% average annual return after all fees versus a benchmark 8% during my 14-year-run and there's no reason to think I got stupid when I started this project and I still think it a project. You get what other people paid millions for and all I can do is my best, but my best in the face of this president isn't good enough. From what I can tell, nobody else's best is either.
In other words, I can't envision a world where I can extract myself from this position until Friday, even as I would like Monday's prices. That said, I want you to know if there is additional clarity that exempts Apple, but not Samsung — and from what I can tell that hasn't brought up outside of me mentioning it Friday and who knows if the White House even listened — I will have to change my mind back to my previous, much more positive view.
Who knows what "exemption" means anymore if you can have an exemption Friday and an excommunication Sunday. As John Maynard Keynes told us, if the facts change, we must change, too. 
The problems with Apple being "transferred," a better word than reshoring, is that it would gut earnings for years and reduce it to an also-ran tech company. I have no other way to say it. We might still prefer the iPhone, but the iPhone in your hand may be your phone for good. Why upgrade if the cost is $3,000, unless a Democrat wins the next election, and the candidate runs on some sort of peaceful coexistence between us and China. 
Of course, it is possible that the Apple doomsday decision might be alleviated as part of some sort of "talking with China" policy, meaning it is better to talk than have an economic war devolve to a hot war. That's something we want to avoid but it is not clear if the far-more-prepared China feels the same way. Such a strategy can't mean permanent status for Apple to build iPhones in China because there is no imperative in this White House to help Apple whatsoever. In fact, the antipathy toward Apple is a relatively untold story that only I insist on telling. Believe me, there is no love lost, despite Apple's commitment to spend more than $500 billion in the U.S. over the next fours. There's a constituency within the White House that still believes Apple is two-faced, all talk and no action. 
I am not an Apple defender or a promoter. All I can do is tell you that there are some in the White House who feel Apple is a bad actor, and the president, for all I know, is among them. The unnerving silence from Apple just puts the reset on Trump Time. 
Suffice it to say, this new position is made with a heavy heart. Apple has been making us money since it was about $5 share. But sentiment is not something in keeping with portfolio management, and as of now, it's a dismal prospect for my trust.
Nvidia bought itself some time. But like Apple, it's pretty much impossible for Nvidia to go full bore in the U.S. There are multiple reasons to still like Nvidia. It is the best tech company in the world. You can't make functional robots without Nvidia chips. They hold the key to whoever is going to win the chatbot race. They are the guts of autonomous cars.
However, something happened on Friday night that reminded me what Nvidia the stock has really become. I happen to go by the options wing of the New York Stock Exchange and was horrified to see how many options were traded on Nvidia of all timeframes. Knowing that, and following the plethora of zero-day options and the ridiculous double- and triple-levered options on this stock, it has become a plaything of the ignorant. When a stock becomes that much of a football, it is truly hostage to all of the rumors and innuendos and is trapped by gossip more than by demand for Nvidia's chips.
Nvidia is, in short, a meme stock.
I don't own meme stocks. 
Nvidia the stock is divorced from the fundamentals of Nvidia the company. It doesn't matter that CEO Jensen Huang says that the Chinese Deepseek initiative is actually positive for Nvidia. It doesn't matter that I believe Microsoft's cooling data center ardor just means it is transferring cap ex to OpenAI so it can make its quarter. It doesn't matter that other hyperscalers swear by their data center needs or that the arms merchant that is CoreWeave will most likely tell us a story of "sold out" of all of Nvidia's chips. 
It doesn't matter because the stock is captured by lunatics. How can my charitable trust be held hostage by lunatics? 
Once again, I have to measure the temper of the times, and the fluidity of events, and recognize that they have been overtaken by its meme status, and I feel I have lost my way with Nvidia as it has become a name and not a company.
How this all happened remains a mystery to me because we were onto Nvidia seven years ago and I have chosen to be ignorant to the metamorphosis of this stock's status. Further, I had hoped that the stock had shed those fellow travelers, those who knew little about the company except that its stock had strong  momentum and the proper direction. I thought that after its precipitous fall it would lose its meme status. 
It has not.
It is no longer investible under these circumstances. Stocks change, we change. William Jennings Bryan once famously said that "you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold," and likewise we can't crucify our portfolios upon a cross of Nvidia. It's all fitting given that the president fashions himself as an acolyte of the relatively unstudied William McKinley, the Gilded Age president much admired by Trump. 
Of course, it's not just tech that is being reset. Friday's bank earnings were flat-out dispiriting as you might have read in our excellent synopses. 
Wells Fargo missed. It just did. I don't know how, given that the cadence of the quarter was a good one and the compliance overhang is lessening. But JPMorgan didn't miss and the disparity was painful. BlackRock turned out to be much more hostage to the worst beginning of a presidential stock market since Herbert Hoover. In that environment, it's difficult to own an asset gatherer as the assets themselves are going down in value. 
As these columns are devoid of spin, Wells Fargo and Blackrock missed the mark. 
Why stay with Wells? I liked the cadence and I hope the asset cap, now seven years on, should be removed with a more open-minded Federal Reserve and a much better-run management team without anyone left from the old regime. That makes it needlessly punitive. As we mentioned in our summary, Wells bought a lot of stock back at a real bad level, something akin to what Nucor did. We need to watch these buybacks during such treacherous times. I am not wedded to Wells, but it is cheap and will have loan growth unless we have a recession. The stock acted as if the recession has already started.
Blackrock was going for higher multiple status with all of this public-private infrastructure investing. It also has the best technology in its Aladdin programming. But without the outperformance of its most important asset — stocks — the infra plan was just dross, something to dress up the company's underperformance. You should not have a premium multiple if you are levered to the value of stocks, hence the hideous action of this stock since we purchased it.
We are patient and our patience has historically rewarded us. BlackRock can regain its allure. But it seems like a big mistake right now, one that you could argue could not be foreseen. Did anyone think that Trump 2.0 would be the worst thing that could ever happen to stocks? That said, who cares about forgiveness? I care about a degree of proficiency as a manager and while Wells has been a good one over time, it's been horrendous this year, but not as bad as BlackRock. At least Wells has been making us money. 
I am furious at myself because of BlackRock.
If we sell BlackRock right here and the market turns up we will have made a mistake. After all of these years, it turned out to be a bull market stock and not much more. 
The resets are all over the place. Anything even remotely connected to China is something that feels like investing in there in 1971, before President Richard Nixon went to China. It is arguable that you must sell anything connected to China and that includes Danaher and Dupont. 
The latter is so painful, as it went from winner to loser despite an ever-so-slight exposure to the Chinese government's hit list. It's not the electronics division that is being spun off. But the electronics division now has the sword of Damocles over its head so we have not bought more. We can't. Who knows if electronics is next? The good news, if there is any, is that the electronics division is now recognized as worthless as part of any sum-of-the-parts analysis. 
Danaher is a once-great company that can become at least a better company the day that CEO Rainer Blair is fired. I have done enough work away from Wall Street to know that there is a basic failed initiative of the company to seed potential clients. It just disappeared under Blair and that's still one more indication on top of his ridiculously suboptimal buyback and endless missed quarters. All of this company's history since the time I first started investing in it in the 1980s indicated it would pivot and do the right thing. That history is, in a word, rendered worthless by the CEO.
Final reset: the data center. Once the keystone of the new industrial revolution, it is now a sign of profligacy. That has made Dover and Eaton, which have small portions of the data center as keystones of their stocks, considered washed up. Dover is a company made up of a portfolio of different end markets and should not be held to a data center pigeonhole. 
However, I have no illusions about Eaton, though it has the data center as well as climate controls as bedrock product lines. The swiftness with which the market changed their stripes caught us unawares and big gains weren't taken. 
That sin is on us. Damn, again, my woulda, shoulda anger steams beneath a somewhat placid exterior.
Once again, ahead of a Wednesday Monthly Meeting, I don the hair suit of portfolio shame. I figure let's get it over with so we can spend more time on your questions than we have typically done. That way, we can be more expansive on what you want and less remonstrative in the most painful of ways. So get those questions in. Unless something changes radically, it will be business as usual in the Trump regime and everything is minute by minute. Witness the addition of Dell to the bullpen, only to have it cast off to oblivion and then brought back from the dead on Friday.
Bear with us. We will get it right more often than others. Understand that the situation is fluid because the president's judgment is fluid, not because our tenets are forgotten. We can do better, but we can't be clairvoyant and clairvoyance is called for in this market.

Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, Financials) are taking major steps to expand their footprint in artificial intelligence and data centers as the U.S. government holds off on new export restrictions and semiconductor stocks face turbulent trading.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.
Nvidia will continue selling its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China after the Trump administration decided against imposing new export restrictions, according to several media reports. The decision followed a meeting between Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang and President Donald J. Trump, easing investor fears that the company's access to one of its key markets would be curtailed.
The policy update came amid heightened volatility in semiconductor stocks. Nvidia shares surged nearly 19% on Wednesday after Trump announced a 90-day pause on most tariffsexcluding those targeting Chinabefore falling 5.8% to close at $107.74 on Thursday.
The company also introduced its latest product, the Blackwell Ultra AI chips, at the recent GPU Technology Conference. The new chips aim to meet growing demand for high-performance computing power in AI development and are expected to further strengthen Nvidia's market position as competitors ramp up their own efforts.
AMD, meanwhile, closed a $4.9 billion acquisition of ZT Systems, a data-center hardware provider. The deal is expected to help AMD expand its product offerings for major cloud customers, including Microsoft (MSFT, Financials) and Meta Platforms (META, Financials), as it seeks to better compete with Nvidia in AI-driven infrastructure.
The company also announced a strategic partnership with Oracle (ORCL, Financials) to develop a large-scale AI computing cluster composed of 30,000 MI355X accelerators. The chips will be manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM, Financials) using its 3-nanometer process, and will feature AMD's new CDNA 4 architecture. AMD said the initiative is part of its broader Advancing AI 2025 roadmap, which includes investments in new hardware, software platforms, and ecosystem development.
Despite these strategic advances, AMD stock dropped 9.6% on Thursday to $87.52 following a 23.8% gain on Wednesdayits largest single-day percentage jump in nearly a decade. The spike and subsequent dip reflect broader market reactions to U.S. trade policy uncertainty and concerns about competition and traction in the AI chip space.
Both companies are positioning themselves to benefit from long-term trends in artificial intelligence and cloud computing, although risks related to regulatory policy and competitive pressure remain in play.

Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have made NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA Quick QuoteNVDA  -  Free Report)     a Wall Street darling for some time. On the other hand, Broadcom Inc.’s (AVGO Quick QuoteAVGO  -  Free Report)     recent share repurchase plan, along with its planned moves to capitalize on the growing AI field, has delighted income-oriented investors.  
However, the latest trade war between the United States and several other countries has caused market turmoil, with shares of NVIDIA and Broadcom declining 19.9% and 25.7% year to date. This presents an opportunity to buy these quality stocks at a discounted price for long-term gains. But which stock is the better bargain? Let’s explore –  
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
NVIDIA leads the growing graphics processing unit (GPU) market with over 80% share, giving the Jensen Huang-led company a competitive edge over its peers. More than Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (AMD Quick QuoteAMD  -  Free Report)     ROCm software platform, NVIDIA’s CUDA software platform is in demand among developers.  
At the same time, there is an insane demand for NVIDIA’s new Blackwell chips among notable tech firms due to their energy efficiency and faster AI interfaces. The older Hopper chips also maintain steady demand due to their higher quality compared to rival Intel Corporation’s (INTC Quick QuoteINTC  -  Free Report)     chips (read more: Can Intel Be the Turnaround Stock of 2025? Is the Time to Buy Now?).
NVIDIA, meanwhile, is well-poised to make the most of the increase in AI data center spending. Top cloud computing stocks are fulfilling the increase in demand for AI workloads by acquiring GPUs and are spending $250 billion on AI data center infrastructure. One of NVIDIA’s prominent customers, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT Quick QuoteMSFT  -  Free Report)    , may have reduced data center spending, but Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL Quick QuoteGOOGL  -  Free Report)     and Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN Quick QuoteAMZN  -  Free Report)     are now supporting NVIDIA in this aspect. 
Broadcom expects the demand for its custom AI accelerator to increase in the near future and the market size for its execution processing units (XPUs) to touch $60-90 billion by fiscal 2027, way higher than last year’s $12.2 billion. 
Broadcom’s XPUs can work on a particular workload and even outdo NVIDIA’s GPUs. Moreover, they have the competence to perform tasks more affordably than GPUs. Thus, banking on the rise in demand for accelerator chips, Broadcom is now developing a 2-nanometer AI XPU, which is unique. The company’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), known to support AI and machine learning, are witnessing strong demand as well. 
No doubt, with GPUs and XPUs gaining popularity in the coming years, and AI infrastructure spending increasing, the future does look bright for both NVIDIA and Broadcom. However, from a long-term perspective, NVIDIA is a better choice than Broadcom.  
This is because NVIDIA has been able to generate profits more proficiently than Broadcom, with its net profit margin coming in at 55.9%, more than AVGO’s 18.5%.  
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
NVIDIA has also been able to control its expenditures and generate profits in a much better way than Broadcom since its return on equity (ROE) of 117.6% outshined AVGO’s 38.5%. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
But from a short-term viewpoint, Broadcom has an upper hand over NVIDIA. After all, Broadcom is a solid dividend payer, which is indicative of a better-quality business that can keep the company immune to the current market vagaries. 
Broadcom has increased its dividends 6 times over the past five years, and its payout ratio sits at a healthy 52% of earnings. Broadcom also has sufficient cash balance to pay off its dividends. Check Broadcom’s dividend history here. 
On the contrary, NVIDIA’s payout ratio sits at a paltry 1% of earnings and the company increased dividends only once in the past five years. Check NVIDIA’s dividend history here. 
NVIDIA presently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), whereas Broadcom carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.

Bryan Catanzaro stuck out at Nvidia. In the hive of engineering drones at the company’s Californian headquarters, he was the dreamer. His hair was long and he dressed like a jester in statement glasses and loud, tacky shirts. He was patient and kind, and he spoke in a soothing, gentle voice. He was the only Nvidia engineer I met who had a humanities degree.
In 2013, having worked at the company for a couple of years, Catanzaro was struggling. His big idea was to create a software library that would allow neural networks, intelligent computer systems modelled on the human brain, to train faster and more effectively. However, when he presented his prototype to Nvidia’s software team early that year, they panned it. 
Catanzaro decided to make his case directly to Jensen Huang, the Taiwanese-American chief executive who had built Nvidia from scratch. At the time, Nvidia was still primarily a graphics company making the chips that powered shoot-’em-up computer games such as Quake and Call of Duty. Neural networks did not seem to be on Huang’s dashboard.
To Catanzaro’s surprise, Huang was immediately intrigued. Following their first meeting, Huang cleared his schedule and spent an entire weekend reading about artificial intelligence, a subject about which he knew little. Another meeting soon followed, in which Catanzaro was amazed to find that his boss now knew as much, perhaps more, about neural nets as he did.
By the middle of 2013, Huang was vibrating with wild‑eyed, resonant intensity. He called Catanzaro into the conference room that he was using as an office and told him that he considered his proposal to be the single most important project in his company’s 20-year history. The whiteboard on the wall had been cleared of diagrams; in its place, Huang had written the cryptic acronym “OIALO”. This, Huang said, stood for “Once in a Lifetime Opportunity”.
It sometimes took Huang a while to warm up to ideas but with AI he had experienced a damascene epiphany. “He got it immediately, before anybody,” said David Kirk, Nvidia’s former chief scientist. “He was the first to see what it could be. He really was the first.” 
Huang concluded that neural networks would revolutionise society and that he could use Nvidia’s parallel computing model to corner the market on the necessary hardware. He announced that he was betting the company. “He sent out an email on Friday evening saying everything is going to deep learning, and that we were no longer a graphics company,” Greg Estes, a vice-president at Nvidia, recalled. “By Monday morning, we were an AI company. Literally, it was that fast.”
As Nvidia moved into AI, Huang abandoned his hobbies. His appetite for mischief diminished, he stopped practising table tennis and his beloved teppan grill went cold. He even stopped returning texts. “He was just so, so focused on work,” recalled Jens Horstmann, his closest friend. “It was all he could talk about.” 
From the day Huang had started his career at the age of 20, he had worked relentlessly, putting in consecutive 12-hour days, six days a week for three decades. Now past 50, and with his children grown, he began to work even harder. “OIALO” was repeated at every meeting.
In the past, to relax, Huang had enjoyed going to the cinema by himself. He preferred big-budget popcorn flicks, particularly the Avengers films, which he watched as much to grade the execution of the CGI as for the story. However, he soon became tired of audience members pestering him for selfies. Eventually, he stopped going. From 2014, there was only work. There was only AI.
A decade later, Nvidia is one of the world’s most valuable companies, worth more than $3 trillion. Its market capitalisation purportedly represents the expected value of the company’s future earnings but it is really a giant, GDP-sized bet on the capabilities of one 62-year-old man. 
Nvidia’s value also reflects the extraordinary speed of its computer chips. Using graphics processing technology originally designed to optimise games such as Grand Theft Auto, Nvidia’s chips work at such remarkable speed that every other big technology company, from Meta and Google to Tesla and Apple, now uses them to power its AI. 
Neural networks form the basis for the chatbots and large language models that have brought AI into the mainstream, which means Huang’s wager has paid off spectacularly. The Taiwanese boy who arrived in America aged nine, and was accidentally sent by his uncle to a Baptist academy for troubled children in Kentucky, has come an extraordinarily long way. The company he founded at a Denny’s fast-food outlet in 1993, the same chain where he had worked as a dishwasher and a busboy for pocket money, has made him one of the wealthiest men alive. 
To the sanctified roster of Jobs, Bezos, Gates and Zuckerberg, one can now add the name Huang. “I’m very rich now,” he said last year. “Do you know how rich I am?” It wasn’t a boast. I asked him whether he had a plan for what to do with the money. “I have no idea,” he said. “None.”
Nvidia’s success has also made many of its employees multimillionaires. Not all of them have been able to stick the course, however. “Interacting with Jensen is like sticking your finger in the electrical socket,” Catanzaro said. “Jensen is not an easy person to get along with all the time. I’ve been afraid of Jensen sometimes. But I also know that he loves me.”
When Huang explains his point of view for the first time, he does so in a measured voice, moving from premises to arguments to conclusions. His interlocutor then has two options: agree with his line of thinking or risk detonation. Those who contradict him are often shocked when he explodes in fury. This is the wrath of Huang.
Spectators are important to Huang — when he dresses down an employee, he usually does so in public so others can learn from the experience. (“Failure must be shared,” he once said.) If a project is delayed, Huang commands that the person responsible stand up and explain to an audience, in detail, every single thing that has gone wrong. Huang then delivers a withering analysis of their performance. Such corporate struggle sessions are not for everyone. “You can kind of see right away who is going to last here, and who is not,” says Dwight Dierck, a senior Nvidia executive. “If someone starts getting defensive, you just know that person won’t be long at Nvidia.”
One former employee recalled a time when he bungled a minor assignment. Huang confronted him in front of three dozen executives, asking him how long he had been with the company and what his salary was. The employee sheepishly provided the numbers. In his head, Huang calculated the employee’s career compensation and asked for all of it to be refunded. The exercise didn’t feel like a joke. “He was kind of serious,” the employee said. “I practically didn’t sleep for three weeks.”
Kirk believed that Huang’s outbursts were purposeful. “Yelling at people was part of this motivational strategy,” he said. “You might think he’s just mad but I think it was premeditated. And it works. It annoys people but it does work. When he’s torturing people, he’s forcing them to learn a lesson — and they certainly would never forget it.”
His anger wasn’t always confined to the office. Horstmann recalled attending one family gathering when Huang botched a complex dish that he was preparing. Standing in his bespoke kitchen, with his daughter, Madison, who had trained at Le Cordon Bleu, standing nearby, Huang exploded and began to scream at his inadequate equipment. “I think we all understood we had to get out of the kitchen,” Horstmann said. “It was just time for Jensen to yell at his stove.” 
Yet even those who disliked his managerial tactics often had positive things to say about Huang personally. Speaking to more than 100 former and current Nvidia employees, almost all had a tender story about him to relate. One, the same person Huang had humiliated in front of dozens of people asking for a refund of his salary, said that when he was diagnosed with a serious medical issue, Huang offered to pay in full for his treatment.
Huang’s combination of love, fear and guilt was a seductive and powerful motivator. “You felt like you couldn’t let him down,” said Sharon Clay, a senior Nvidia engineer. “You just couldn’t.”
The loyalty and determination of Huang’s team has helped him to build the Manhattan Project of computer science, an AI machine that might eliminate art, become self-aware, perhaps even destroy humanity as we know it. 
I first interviewed Huang in 2023 and in every conversation since I had pressed him about the wisdom of unleashing such power. He gave me variations on the same answer every time. I brought up the concerns of Geoffrey Hinton, the world’s leading AI scientist, that “humanity is just a passing phase in the evolution of intelligence”. Huang scoffed: “A lot of researchers don’t understand why he’s saying that. Maybe it’s bringing attention to his own work.” 
I was stunned by this statement. This wasn’t some guy on the street waving a sign; this was the greatest mind in AI telling us we should be very, very worried. Huang was coldly dismissive. “Look, you buy a hot dog, so the machine recommends you ketchup and mustard,” Huang said. “Is that the end of humanity?”
Huang insisted AI was safe. He had his own incentives, of course — money but also pride. Having waged a long, lonely battle to make parallel computing profitable, he was now determined to enjoy its rewards. He seemed offended by technologists such as Elon Musk and Sam Altman, who performatively decried the risks of AI while continuing to purchase his hardware. 
Huang’s confidence was also born out of the many ways in which AI wasn’t like the biological brain. The neural net did not have a hypothalamus, a hippocampus or a pineal gland. The neural net was unaffected by hormones, had no sex drive, didn’t go to sleep, couldn’t love its children and never had a dream. A well‑trained model mimicked, and sometimes exceeded, our own capacity for cogitation but it had no sense of memory, no emotions, no imagination, no reproductive function and no instinct to survive. In this sense, one could not say it was really alive. 
But I couldn’t shake my anxiety. Was Huang, seduced by the power of what he had built, gambling with the future of our species? I had to know. I had to ask him one last time.
My final interview with Huang took place on a Friday in March last year at Nvidia’s Endeavor headquarters in Santa Clara, just after the company’s annual conference. 
Huang, after four days of nonstop presentations, interviews and technical demos, was visibly exhausted. People were becoming a little critical of him, I noticed. At a recent press conference, one journalist had asked whether he was the new Robert Oppenheimer. “Oppenheimer was building a bomb,” Huang replied. “We’re not doing that.”
Our interview started amicably enough. I congratulated Huang on his fine performance at the keynote, then asked him about life in Taiwan, about his family, about how he was handling his newfound fame. His answers were curt and to the point.
Then I asked him specifically what new jobs might be created — as opposed to destroyed — by AI. I watched the blood drain from his face. I had hit the tripwire.
“Is it going to … is it going to destroy jobs?” Huang asked, his voice crescendoing with anger. “Are calculators going to destroy math? That conversation is so old and I’m so, so tired of it.
 “I don’t want to talk about it any more. It’s the same conversation over and over and over and over and over again. We invented agriculture and then made the marginal cost of producing food zero. It was good for society. We manufactured electricity at scale and it caused the marginal cost of chopping down trees, lighting fires, carrying fires and torches around to approximately zero, and we went off to do something else. And then we made the marginal cost of doing calculations — long division. We made it zero.” 
He was yelling now. “We make the marginal cost of things zero, generation after generation after generation, and this exact conversation happens every single time.”
I tried to switch subjects but it was no use. His anger was tinged with disgust. It seemed uncontained, omnidirectional and wildly inappropriate. “This cannot be a ridiculous sci-fi story,” he said. He gestured to his frozen public relations representatives at the end of the table. “Do you guys understand? I didn’t grow up on a bunch of sci-fi stories and this is not a sci-fi movie. These are serious people doing serious work. This is not a freaking joke. This is not a repeat of Arthur C Clarke. I didn’t read his f***ing books. I don’t care about those books. It’s not — we’re not a sci-fi, repeat. This company is not a manifestation of Star Trek. We are not doing those things. We are serious people doing serious work.” 
For the next 20 minutes, in a tone that alternated between accusatory, exasperated and belittling, he questioned my professionalism, questioned my interview approach, questioned my dedication to the project.
I left the interview bewildered. I had been in plenty of tense conversations with executives but I had never had someone explode at me in this way. I was stunned — but also, if I’m honest, I was a little giddy. To be targeted by the wrath of Huang was in a certain sense an honour: a rite of passage that everyone who gained admittance to his inner circle underwent. Walking away from the conference room, I turned to one of the PR reps. “That went well,” I said. He laughed. “Oh, that?” he said. “That was nothing.”
The World According to Jensen
Work like you’re going bankrupt
Huang encourages his employees to constantly behave as if the company was teetering on the verge of bankruptcy, even when it is making massive profits. For many years, Jensen opened staff presentations with the words “Our company is thirty days from going out of business.” Even today at Nvidia, this sentence remains the corporate mantra. 
Find a uniform
Every time I saw Jensen, he was wearing the same all‑black T‑shirt with a Thomas Burberry monogram. He bought twenty four of the shirts in 2020 and rotated them every day for four years. 
Work at the speed of light
Huang employed a scheduling technique he calls the “speed of light” and drilled this management concept into his employees with the fervor of religious doctrine. “Speed of light” does not mean, as one might assume, to move quickly. Instead, Huang encouraged managers to identify the absolute fastest that something could conceivably be accomplished, given an unlimited budget, and assuming that every single thing went right. (For example, traveling from New York to London at the “speed of light” would involve perfect weather, zero traffic, and a supersonic plane.) 
Managers could then work backward from this unachievable constant to realistic but still impressive delivery times. Huang pursues this unattainable ideal every day of his life. “I should make sure that I’m sufficiently exhausted from working that no one can keep me up at night,” he said. “That’s really the only thing I can control.” 
Always see imperfections
When Nvidia’s new headquarters opened, the architect Hao Ko led Huang and a group of executives on a tour. “The place was finished, it looks amazing, we’re doing the tour, and
he’s questioning me about the placement of the water fountains,” Ko said. “He was upset because they were next to the bathrooms! That’s required by code, and this is a billion‑ dollar building! But he just couldn’t let it go.” “I’m never satisfied,” Huang said. “No matter what it is, I only see imperfections.”
20,000 emails a week
Sometime around 2020, Huang asked everyone at the company to submit a weekly list of the five most important things they were working on. Every Friday from that day forward, he received twenty thousand emails.
Brevity was encouraged; Huang would randomly sample from this pool of correspondence late into the night. In turn, he communicated to his staff by writing hundreds of emails per day, often only a few words long. (One executive compared the emails to haiku. Another compared them to ransom notes.) His responsiveness was superhuman. “You’d email him at 2 a.m. and receive a reply at 2:05 a.m.,” Dally said. “Then you’d email him again at 6a.m. and receive a reply at 6:05 a.m.”
Do the hardest thing first
By 5am, Jensen was usually up and working. He always began his workday with his most important long‑term project, figuring that as long as he addressed it, the day couldn’t be considered a bust no matter what else happened.
Never settle for less than perfect
In the early 2000s, Huang bought a plot of land in Los Altos Hills, overlooking Silicon Valley. 
There he commissioned a six‑thousand‑ square‑ foot mansion with five bedrooms, seven bathrooms, a swimming pool, and an oversized garage. He bought two Ferraris (his and hers) and started collecting expensive whiskey. 
But not even a custom dream house could meet Jensen’s standards. Returning home from work one day, he noticed that the glass doors to the garden of his mansion did not perfectly align with the view to the pool house out back. The lack of symmetry annoyed him, so he ordered the pool house uprooted and, at considerable expense, had it moved 18ft to the side.
Don’t share the load
Management professors theorise that a chief executive should ideally have between eight and twelve direct reports. Huang had 55.

Oops, something went wrong
Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. 
Shares of semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) surged 18.7% on April 9, after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on the higher "reciprocal tariffs." Instead, he has authorized a "lowered reciprocal tariff of 10%" -- in line with the 10% baseline tariff set on all imports.
Investors had long been worried about the U.S. government's decision to impose import tariffs on products from various trading partners. Since this can lead to rising costs, disruptions in the supply chain, and retaliatory tariffs on American goods, many U.S. stocks saw a dramatic decline in early April 2025. The temporary pause in reciprocal tariffs seems well received by Wall Street.
Nvidia's stock is down nearly 25% from its recent high in January 2025. Although this is not a very encouraging sign, it is a solid improvement from the almost 38% drawdown from the high on April 4.
So, does valuation correction present an opportunity for investors to buy, hold, or sell Nvidia stock now? Let's find out.
Regulatory risks have emerged as a primary headwind for Nvidia. In April 2025, the U.S. government announced its decision to levy a hefty 32% tariff on imports from Taiwan and a 34% tariff from China. China responded by levying 84% retaliatory tariffs on imports from the U.S. In retaliation, the U.S. government has increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 104%.
Although semiconductors have been excluded from this round of tariffs, there are signals of a potential escalation of trade wars between the U.S. and China.
Jefferies analysts fear the possibility of additional sector-specific tariffs, including semiconductors, in subsequent tariff rounds. If true, it can lead to significant supply chain disruptions and margin pressures for Nvidia, considering that the company depends heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's fabs for chip manufacturing.
The U.S. government has long been mulling stricter controls on chip sales to China. The Chinese government's recently introduced energy-efficiency guidelines, also urge companies to use chips adhering to strict requirements in new data centers or expansions. Since Nvidia's best-selling H20 chip does not fulfil these requirements, it may hurt the company's Chinese business -- accounting for almost 13% of its revenues in fiscal 2025 (ending Jan. 26).
Nvidia is also encountering competitive pressures, though other chip manufacturers are significantly behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. The company is also experiencing short-term gross margin pressures due to the ongoing ramp-up of its Blackwell systems.
Despite these challenges, multiple catalysts can drive up Nvidia's share prices in the coming months.
Nvidia enjoys an unmatched technological edge in AI computing, which is evident considering its over 90% share in the AI GPU market. The company has developed a robust AI infrastructure optimized for several AI computational workloads with significant growth opportunities. These include pre-training scaling or building and upgrading foundational models with large amounts of multimodal data, post-training scaling or customizing and fine-tuning foundational models, and inferencing, including complex reasoning.
The recently launched Blackwell architecture systems have been specially architected for inference workloads (deploying and running models in a real-time environment) across various deployment environments such as on-premises, cloud, or hybrid. Blackwell is also optimized for computation-heavy reasoning inference workloads, demonstrating 25 times higher token throughput and 20 times lower cost than the Hopper 100 chips. Hence, with enterprise demand increasingly shifting from training workloads to more recurring inference workloads, Blackwell is expected to continue to be a significant growth catalyst for Nvidia.
Besides hardware, Nvidia has built a solid software ecosystem with over 5.9 million developers using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and other software platforms. The company has also recently introduced software offerings such as Nvidia AI Enterprise and Nvidia Inference Microservices to enable enterprises to deploy AI solutions effectively. This software advantage has led to high switching costs, which has resulted in a sticky customer base.
Finally, the rapid adoption of AI agents and robotics is also proving to be a significant growth avenue for Nvidia. Blackwell chips are well poised to benefit from the evolving agentic AI opportunity, as it has the computational power and low latency required for building systems capable of making complex decisions and planning.
Nvidia is trading at 24.45 times forward earnings, far lower than its five-year average of 71.54x. Hence, it is evident that most of the risks are already priced at the company's share price.
But Nvidia also has a history of rebounding significantly after deep falls. Some of the recent events can better highlight this trend.
This was seen in 2018, when the stock crashed over 53% from its peak in early October 2018 to its low in late December 2018. The decline was mainly due to the crypto market crash amid the global tech sell-off, resulting in excess inventory buildup for Nvidia. However, the stock recovered by over 65% in 2019, after inventory levels normalized and sales in gaming and data center segments started showing strong momentum.
Nvidia stock also crashed by 30% from its recent peak in February 2020 to its low in March 2020 due to marketwide uncertainty and supply chain disruptions in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, by March 2021, the stock had soared over 100%, driven mainly by increased demand for gaming and data center services during the pandemic.
Finally, Nvidia stock crashed almost 66% from November 2021 to mid-October 2022, due to concerns about rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions. But then, the stock had recovered over 200% by October 2023, fueled by explosive demand in AI and data center markets and the company's focus on product innovation.
Hence, historically, Nvidia has returned even stronger within 12 months after a significant stock decline. Therefore, it makes sense for retail investors to acquire at least a small stake in this stock to benefit from its future growth prospects.

Citi analyst Atif Malik reduced his price target on Nvidia (NVDA, Financials) to $150 from $163, citing concerns over reduced capital expenditures by major cloud customers and broader uncertainty in enterprise spending.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.
In a note to clients, Malik said he now expects Nvidia's graphics processing unit (GPU) shipments for calendar years 2025 and 2026 to decline by 3% and 5%, respectively. The adjustment reflects Citi's revised hyperscaler capital expenditure forecast, which assumes 35% growth in 2025 and 15% in 2026. The cut was attributed in part to anticipated lower investment by Microsoft (MSFT, Financials) and a heightened risk that enterprises may delay technology purchases due to a weakening global macroeconomic backdrop, including pressures from an ongoing trade war.
Despite the downward revision in unit shipments, Malik said the impact on Nvidia's sales will be limited, as the company is expected to partially offset the effect through price inelasticity in its AI-focused GPU product lines. As a result, Citi lowered its earnings per share forecast for Nvidia by 3% in 2025 and 6% in 2026.
Citi's revised $150 target is based on a price-to-earnings multiple of 30 times its discounted 2026 EPS estimate, aligning with the stock's historical average over the past three to five years. The investment firm maintained its Buy rating, citing Nvidia's technology leadership in the AI hardware segment as a key support for long-term growth.

April 11 - Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) drew investor attention Friday after Citi (NYSE:C)revised down its forecasts for both chipmakers, citing weakening enterprise demand and tariff uncertainty.
Citi analyst Atif Malik lowered Nvidia's 2025 and 2026 earnings projections by 3% and 6%, respectively, pointing to reduced cloud spending, particularly by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and the rising risk of slower investment due to the ongoing U.S.-China trade standoff. He also trimmed the firm's GPU unit forecasts by 3% for calendar year 2025 and 5% for 2026.
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA.
Malik noted Nvidia may try to offset higher GPU costs by raising prices, but cautioned this could compress margins. He cut his price target on the stock to $150 from $160 but maintained a Buy rating.
Marvell faced similar pressure. The bank lowered its fiscal 2027 revenue and profit outlooks by 5% and 8%, respectively, citing weaker-than-expected hyperscaler demand. Citi also slashed its AI chip estimates by 20%, noting that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) may diversify ASIC suppliers for future Trainium products. Malik reiterated a Buy on the stock despite the cuts.

The trade war between two of the world’s biggest economies, China and the US, is deepening even further. In a tit-for-tat retaliatory move, China has imposed an 84% tariff on all imports from the US starting April 10. This move comes after Trump’s duties on Beijing, which have now been increased even further to a whopping 145%.
Tech stocks have been plunging in response. Apple, for instance, has been doing the majority of its manufacturing in China, and the trade war is likely going to raise the price of its iPhones. Even though President Trump has confidence that the tech giant can make its phones in the U.S., experts aren’t so sure.

According to Needham analyst Laura Martin, reshoring iPhone manufacturing may take years and result in the price of iPhones skyrocketing. Similarly, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has said that an iPhone would cost $3,500 if produced in the U.S.
Nevertheless, President Donald Trump has just announced a 90-day pause on his administration’s “reciprocal tariffs.” These would have affected the company’s production locations in Vietnam, India, and Thailand.
Amid all this chaos, artificial intelligence continues to make leaps and bounds. In recent news, Silicon Valley startup Lightmatter has revealed it has developed a new type of computer chip. This chip is capable of both speeding up artificial intelligence work and using less electricity in the process.
The company is one of the few that seeks to use beams of light to move data between computers, instead of electronic signals. However, the company also believes that it can use these very beams of light to carry out the computation.
“What we’re doing is looking at the future of where processors can go. We fundamentally care about computers, and this is one of the alternative paths. There’s trillions of dollars of economic value that’s behind the idea that computers will keep getting better.”
In other news, President Donald Trump has recently told Cabinet members that billionaire Elon Musk will leave his administration role in the coming months. Musk has been the subject of hate after his efforts to cut the federal workforce. His involvement in politics has been hurting his company as well.
“I think he’s been amazing, but I also think he’s got a big company to run … And at some point, he’s going to be going back. He wants to. I’d keep him as long as I could keep him.”

We recently published a list of 14 AI Stocks Catching Wall Street’s Attention. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other AI stocks catching Wall Street’s attention.
In the latest development in the feud between OpenAI and Elon Musk, the ChatGPT maker has countersued billionaire Musk, citing a pattern of harassment. The company also asked a federal judge to stop Musk from any “further unlawful and unfair action” against OpenAI in a court case over the company’s future structure that has fueled the AI revolution.
OpenAI claims that Musk has tried “nonstop” to slow down its business for his benefit, accusing him of using “bad-faith tactics” against it to help him control AI technology.
Musk has been actively seeking to stop OpenAI from transitioning to a “for-profit” company, claiming that the transition will be a bad idea, which prioritizes commercial interests and compromises its mission of benefiting humanity.
OpenAI, however, denies these allegations. The company must complete its transition by the end of the year if it seeks to secure the entire $40 billion of its current fundraising round. If the transition fails to complete by year-end, the funding will likely be reduced to US$20 billion.

“Through press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk’s more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims, and a sham bid for OpenAI’s assets, Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI,”
In response, Musk’s legal team has referred to a $97.4 billion unsolicited takeover bid from a Musk-led consortium. This bid was rejected by OpenAI.
“Had OpenAI’s Board genuinely considered the bid as they were obligated to do they would have seen how serious it was. It’s telling that having to pay fair market value for OpenAI’s assets allegedly ‘interferes’ with their business plans.”

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) specializes in AI-driven solutions, offering platforms for data centers, self-driving cars, robotics, and cloud services. One of the biggest analyst calls on Thursday, April 10, was for Nvidia Corporation. Cantor Fitzgerald reiterated the stock as “Overweight,” stating that the stock is defensive.
“We view the AI bucket as still the best place to be long — where we think there is upside to CY25 consensus, particularly at NVDA, AVGO, and TSMC.”
Analysts on Wall Street currently have a consensus “Buy” rating on the stock. The average price target of $175 implies a 58% upside, however, the Street-high target of $235 implies an upside of 113%.

We recently published a list of 12 Best Tech Stocks to Buy For Long-Term Investment. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other tech stocks to buy for long-term investment.
On April 1, Chris Verrone, chief market strategist at Strategas Research Partners, appeared on CNBC’s ‘Closing Bell’ to talk about his outlook on the tech sector. Verrone believes that most of the current market’s negative sentiment has already been factored into recent stock prices. He highlighted that even after the market’s decline, the VIX, and the currency and bond volatility are lower than they were during the mid-March stress period. Plus, fewer stocks are hitting new lows. He thinks that market lows are formed during periods of bad news, and the market will rally from its current level with an anticipated range of 5,900 to 5,950.
Verrone believes that the current downturn is more than a typical 10% correction so it will take some time to figure out the market’s true direction. He emphasized the importance of monitoring market breadth, new highs, and credit conditions in the upcoming weeks and months. He also acknowledged the shift in investor sentiment, with more bears than bulls. As the conversation touched on the impact of the Fed and politics in a market, Verrone stated that he pays more attention to what the 2-year Treasury yield tells him instead of listening to what Fed officials have to say. He noted that the 2-year yield’s decline from 3.83% to 3.85% suggests a shift in the market expectations for the Fed’s actions. He highlighted the resilience of financials during the correction and contrasted it with the weakness of tech. He thinks that, unlike financials that entered the correction as leaders, the tech sector might not be able to regain the leadership role.
While Verrone’s stance acknowledges the current weakness in tech, it’s important to note that the tech sector remains one of the more innovative markets in the long run. For instance, MAG7 continues to be a driving force for this market.

NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a computing infrastructure company. Its Compute & Networking segment comprises Data Center computing platforms and end-to-end networking platforms. The Graphics segment offers various GPUs for gaming, PCs, enterprise workstation graphics, cloud-based visual & virtual computing, infotainment systems, and others.
The company’s Data Center segment generated a record $35.6 billion in FQ4 2025 revenue which marked a 93% year-over-year rise. For the entire FY25, the revenue doubled as compared to the year-ago period due to the surging demand for AI infrastructure. The adoption of the company’s Blackwell architecture drove this growth. In FQ4 alone, Blackwell’s sales reached $11 billion and marked the fastest product ramp in the company’s history. It delivers up to 25x higher token throughput and 20x lower cost than the Hopper 100 for reasoning AI.
On March 28, Bank of America reiterated a Buy rating with a $200 price target for the company due to its optimism about NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) despite the new US AI Diffusion Rules that impact AI chip distribution. Large cloud service providers (CSPs) like Azure, GCP, AWS, and OCI are deploying Blackwell systems to meet the growing demand for AI infrastructure. Consumer internet companies such as Meta are using its GPUs for GenAI and deep learning applications.
Guinness Global Innovators is highly bullish on NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) due to its dominant AI chip market position. It stated the following in its Q4 2024 investor letter:
“For a second year running, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was the Fund’s top performing stock, delivering a stellar return of +177.7% over the year. Since the beginning of last year, Nvidia’s ‘Hopper’ GPUs have been at the centre of exploding demand for chips powerful and efficient enough to facilitate the energy intensive requirements of AI processes within datacentres. Initially possessing over 95% of market share in these types of chips, Nvidia have been quick to entrench their position as the technological leader in the space, launching the successor to the current ‘Hopper’ GPU in March, Blackwell, inhibiting the likes of AMD and Intel making meaningful inroads in taking share of the fast-growing market. Compared to the previous iteration (Hopper) which is continuing to fuel Nvidia’s extreme revenue growth, the Blackwell chip is twice as powerful for training AI models and has 5 times the capability when it comes to “inference” (the speed at which AI models respond to queries). Throughout the year, Nvidia’s financial performance has remained resilient. Quarterly revenues hit $35.1 billion in their most recent quarter, beating consensus expectations by 6% and representing a +94% year-over-year increase. Additionally, Nvidia’s data centre segment, driven by the Hopper (H100) chip, grew fivefold over the past year, underscoring the sustained demand for advanced AI infrastructure. The H100 chip, priced at around $40,000, continues to see significant adoption due to its ability to enhance AI model training efficiency while lowering overall costs. This growth is expected to continue as companies invest in upgrading existing data centres and building new ones, with Nvidia well-positioned to capture a significant share of the estimated $2 trillion market opportunity over the next five years. There have been some concerns over Blackwell production delays causing share price volatility however, Nvidia has recovered swiftly, driven by positive earnings results through the year and assurances from management regarding future supply. Additionally, the release of the H200 chip promises to extend Nvidia’s technological leadership, ensuring continued momentum into 2025. While Nvidia’s valuation remains a topic of debate, the stock is not at a significant premium to history, and it still appears reasonable given its dominant market position, innovative prowess, and exposure to long-term secular growth trends in AI, cloud computing, and data infrastructure. As a result, Nvidia remains well-positioned to deliver sustained outperformance over the long term, making it a cornerstone of growth-oriented portfolios.”
Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of the best tech stocks to buy for long-term investment. While we acknowledge the growth potential of NVDA, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. There is an AI stock that went up since the beginning of 2025, while popular AI stocks lost around 25%.

Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have made NVIDIA Corporation NVDA a Wall Street darling for some time. On the other hand, Broadcom Inc.’s AVGO recent share repurchase plan, along with its planned moves to capitalize on the growing AI field, has delighted income-oriented investors. 
However, the latest trade war between the United States and several other countries has caused market turmoil, with shares of NVIDIA and Broadcom declining 19.9% and 25.7% year to date. This presents an opportunity to buy these quality stocks at a discounted price for long-term gains. But which stock is the better bargain? Let’s explore – 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
NVIDIA leads the growing graphics processing unit (GPU) market with over 80% share, giving the Jensen Huang-led company a competitive edge over its peers. More than Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s AMD ROCm software platform, NVIDIA’s CUDA software platform is in demand among developers. 
At the same time, there is an insane demand for NVIDIA’s new Blackwell chips among notable tech firms due to their energy efficiency and faster AI interfaces. The older Hopper chips also maintain steady demand due to their higher quality compared to rival Intel Corporation’s INTC chips (read more: Can Intel Be the Turnaround Stock of 2025? Is the Time to Buy Now?).
NVIDIA, meanwhile, is well-poised to make the most of the increase in AI data center spending. Top cloud computing stocks are fulfilling the increase in demand for AI workloads by acquiring GPUs and are spending $250 billion on AI data center infrastructure. One of NVIDIA’s prominent customers, Microsoft Corporation MSFT, may have reduced data center spending, but Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN are now supporting NVIDIA in this aspect.
Broadcom expects the demand for its custom AI accelerator to increase in the near future and the market size for its execution processing units (XPUs) to touch $60-90 billion by fiscal 2027, way higher than last year’s $12.2 billion.
Broadcom’s XPUs can work on a particular workload and even outdo NVIDIA’s GPUs. Moreover, they have the competence to perform tasks more affordably than GPUs. Thus, banking on the rise in demand for accelerator chips, Broadcom is now developing a 2-nanometer AI XPU, which is unique. The company’s application-specific integrated chips (ASICs), known to support AI and machine learning, are witnessing strong demand as well.
No doubt, with GPUs and XPUs gaining popularity in the coming years, and AI infrastructure spending increasing, the future does look bright for both NVIDIA and Broadcom. However, from a long-term perspective, NVIDIA is a better choice than Broadcom. 
This is because NVIDIA has been able to generate profits more proficiently than Broadcom, with its net profit margin coming in at 55.9%, more than AVGO’s 18.5%. 
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
NVIDIA has also been able to control its expenditures and generate profits in a much better way than Broadcom since its return on equity (ROE) of 117.6% outshined AVGO’s 38.5%.
Image Source: Zacks Investment Research
But from a short-term viewpoint, Broadcom has an upper hand over NVIDIA. After all, Broadcom is a solid dividend payer, which is indicative of a better-quality business that can keep the company immune to the current market vagaries.
Broadcom has increased its dividends 6 times over the past five years, and its payout ratio sits at a healthy 52% of earnings. Broadcom also has sufficient cash balance to pay off its dividends. Check Broadcom’s dividend history here.
On the contrary, NVIDIA’s payout ratio sits at a paltry 1% of earnings and the company increased dividends only once in the past five years. Check NVIDIA’s dividend history here.
NVIDIA presently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), whereas Broadcom carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.

We recently published a list of 30 Best AI Stocks to Buy According to Billionaires. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires.
The optimism around the United States economy over the past few months, largely due to the AI hype, has been dampened by recent measures undertaken by the Trump administration to shore up US manufacturing. These measures, largely in the form of obscene tariffs on goods imported into the US from overseas, with a particular focus on China, have hit global stocks, resulting in a downward spiral for major indexes. The latest tariff hike has wiped trillions in market capitalization from the Magnificent Seven, a group of seven firms that dominate the benchmark US indexes and are heavily invested in AI. Latest reports from market research firm IDC indicate that if the tariffs stay in place, they are expected to trigger supply chain disruptions and inflationary challenges across various markets, including the IT sector. According to a report from news agency Reuters, global hedge funds, dominated by billionaires, scaled back their risky bets and sought safety before Trump introduced new tariffs last week.
This report was based on data gathered by investment bank Goldman Sachs. Per the data, hedge funds pulled out of bets in emerging markets of Europe and Asia ahead of the announcement of new tariffs. Research by investment bank Morgan Stanley, as seen by Reuters, also echoes these sentiments. Morgan Stanley estimates US long-short funds net leverage quickly fell to 37%, just shy of historical lows, by the end of last week, from over 50% at the beginning of the year. Net leverage measures the difference between a fund’s long and short positions against the value of what it owns including borrowings. JPMorgan also noted in a recent report that the net leverage of hedge funds has dropped to around the lowest since late 2023. The lower the net leverage, the more conservative a hedge fund’s position. Investors expect significant volatility on risk assets in the near term given the tariff uncertainties and suggest a continued risk-off stance.

The latest developments represent a reversal of positions from billionaires who, in the past few months, have often hailed AI as the next transformative technology that would shape the future of economies, industries, and society. Influential billionaires repeatedly advocated for investing heavily in AI for the immense economic value it promised. This bullish thesis was based on research from firms like McKinsey that predicted that AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy in the coming years. For investors, this translated into a chance to own stakes in technologies that could underpin the next generation of global growth. For billionaire investors, AI also represented both a diversification strategy and a chance to influence the direction of a powerful new technology. These investors often take strategic stakes that allow them to shape product development and scaling. Some of the biggest companies these investors made huge bets on are discussed in detail below.

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) provides graphics, computing and networking solutions. As US President Trump weighs further tariffs on products coming into the US from trade rivals like China, a Financial Times report has quoted Jensen Huang, the CEO of NVIDIA, as saying that his firm will spend hundreds of billions of dollars on chips and other electronics manufactured in the US over the next four years. The announcement follows multibillion-dollar US investment plans announced by other technology companies, including Apple. Huang added that the leading artificial intelligence chipmaker was now able to manufacture its latest systems in the US through suppliers such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company and Foxconn, and that he saw a growing competitive threat from Huawei in China.
Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of best AI stocks to buy according to billionaires. While we acknowledge the potential of these AI companies, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Something went wrong
By Kenrick Cai and Krystal Hu
SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet and Nvidia have joined prominent venture capital investors to back Safe Superintelligence (SSI), a startup co-founded by OpenAI's former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever that has quickly risen to become one of the most valuable artificial intelligence startups months after its launch, a source familiar with the matter said.
The funding illustrates renewed interest from the big tech and infrastructure providers in making strategic investments in the startups developing cutting-edge AI that requires massive amounts of computing power. Alphabet, which has its own AI models, earlier in the week announced a deal by its cloud computing arm to sell SSI access to tensor processing units (TPUs), its in-house AI chips.
SSI, which sources say was recently valued at $32 billion in a round led by Greenoaks, is one of the highest-profile startups working on AI model research, thanks to Sutskever's stellar track record in predicting the next big thing in AI development.
Like many of its competitors, it has a huge demand for chips.
Reuters could not determine the exact terms of Alphabet's and Nvidia's investment in SSI. Spokespeople for all three companies declined to comment.
The twin moves by Alphabet's corporate and cloud division with high-profile AI labs including SSI and Anthropic show the tech giant's evolving AI hardware strategy.
Google originally reserved TPUs for in-house use. The deal to sell SSI chips in significant quantities to support its frontier AI research exemplifies the company's ongoing strategy to expand sales to external customers, Darren Mowry, a managing director in charge of Google's partnerships with startups, said in an interview with Reuters this week.
"With these foundational model builders, the gravity is increasing dramatically over to us," he said.
AI developers have historically preferred Nvidia's graphics processing units, which hold more than 80% of the AI chips market.
But SSI is so far primarily using TPUs rather than GPUs for its AI research and development, two sources said.
Google offers both Nvidia GPUs and its own TPUs through its cloud service. Its own chips are intended to excel at specific AI tasks and are more efficient than general-purpose GPUs. These chips have been used to build large-scale AI models, such as Apple and Anthropic, an OpenAI competitor that has received billions of dollars of funding from Google and Amazon.
Google and Nvidia also face a challenger in Amazon, which is building its own competing processors called Trainium and Inferentia. Amazon has said as far back as 2023 that Anthropic would develop its technology on those chips. The tech giant announced in December that Anthropic would be the first customer to use a massive supercomputer powered by hundreds of thousands of its own chips.
In the meantime, Anthropic continues to use TPUs for its AI development and has not decreased spending on Google's chips, two sources said.
It is increasingly common for major cloud providers to invest heavily in AI startups that not only build foundational models but also serve as significant customers of their infrastructure. For instance, Amazon and Google have both invested in Anthropic, while Microsoft has placed substantial bets on OpenAI. Nvidia has also backed OpenAI, as well as Elon Musk's xAI.

We recently published a list of Top 10 Stocks in Ken Griffin’s Portfolio to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stands against other top stocks in Ken Griffin’s portfolio to buy according to analysts.
Ken Griffin is one billionaire investor wary of the negative impact of US President Donald Trump’s combative approach to trade policy. Aggressive trade tariffs in the push to try and settle trade imbalances between the US and other nations have sent shockwaves in the equity markets. Likewise, Griffin believes the damage has already been done, given that the broader equity market has already pulled back significantly since Trump assumed office on January 20, 2025.
“From my vantage point, the bombastic rhetoric, the damage has already been done,” Griffin said Tuesday at the UBS Financial Services Conference in Key Biscayne, Florida. “It’s a huge mistake to resort to this form of rhetoric when you’re trying to drive a bargain because … it tears into the minds of CEOs, policymakers that we can’t depend upon America, as our trading partner.”
The billionaire hedge fund manager’s remarks followed Trump’s signing of an order imposing 25% import duties on steel and aluminum. According to Ken Griffin, Trump’s trade policies have the potential to affect long-term investments for multinational companies. Companies are increasingly slowing down their investments, especially abroad, worried about the long-term impact of trade tariffs.

“It makes it difficult for multinationals, in particular, to think about how to plan for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years, particularly when it comes to long lead time capital investments that could be adversely impacted by a degradation of the current terms of engagement as amongst the leading Western countries when it comes to terms and trade,” he said.
The remarks come on the Fed opting to go slow on interest rate cuts for the second straight meeting after conducting three consecutive rate reductions beginning September 2024. The central bank opted to maintain the benchmark rate at 4.5%, wary of inflation ticking higher amid the ongoing trade war between the US and other countries.
According to the US central bank, GDP growth will slow in 2025, and core inflation will be higher. This partially reflects the anticipated effects of the retaliatory actions and newly imposed U.S. tariffs. The US central bank is going slow on interest rate cuts, and the warning of a potential economic growth slowdown has rattled the equity markets.
After years of blockbuster gains, the S&P 500 has pulled back significantly from record highs. Investors remain wary of the uncertainties triggered by the ongoing trade war and its potential impact, especially on economic growth. It remains to be seen if Citadel Investment Group will continue to average the 19% gain it has accrued annually over the years amid the choppy markets.
Amid the concerns, billionaire investor Ken Griffin remains bullish on some equity plays he believes are well-positioned to benefit amid the current investment environment. While Griffin’s investment portfolio in Citadel Investment Group boasts significant exposure to tech stocks, its $577.87 billion portfolio value also boasts significant stakes in the services healthcare and basic materials sector. The diversification play is one of Griffin ’s investment strategies focusing on identifying and investing in equities expected to provide strong performance relative to the benchmark index. As co-chief investment officer and executive chairman, Griffin plays an active role in the hedge fund’s investment strategy.
We combed Citadel Investment Group’s SEC Q4 2024 13F filings to identify the top 10 stocks in Ken Griffin’s portfolio to buy, according to analysts. From the resultant data, we settled on the top 10 picks trading at significant discounts but with significant upside potential (more than 40%), according to Wall Street Analysts (as of April 11). Finally, we ranked the stocks in ascending order based on their upside potential while also detailing hedge fund sentiments regarding the stocks.
Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a technology giant that designs and supplies graphics processing units (GPUs), application programming interfaces (APIs), and system-on-a-chip units (SoCs). While the stock has given back a significant chunk of the gains accrued in 2024, it is still one of the top stocks to buy, according to analysts, owing to its exposure to the artificial intelligence boom.
With the expected $1 trillion spending on data center infrastructure by 2028, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) should be the biggest beneficiary as a market leader in the provision of GPUs. Its GPUs are the backbone of artificial intelligence and a key catalyst in delivering robust financial results. For its full fiscal year 2024-2025, the company generated $130.5 billion in revenues, up 114% year-over-year. Likewise, it delivered record Q4 2025 revenue of $35.6 billion, up 93% year-over-year.
NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) plans to maintain its edge in both its chips and software. Its new Blackwell Ultra GPU is poised to go on sale in the second half of 2025, strengthening its revenue base and growth prospects. Nvidia projected that Blackwell’s income would be significantly higher than their previous Hopper architecture. On the other hand, Wall Street expects Nvidia’s robust growth to persist, with revenues expected to increase by 52% in the current fiscal year and 22% next year, far exceeding its peers.
Overall, NVDA ranks 5th on our list of top stocks in Ken Griffin’s portfolio to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

=== ARTICLE FROM: https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/oracle-and-nvidia-collaborate-to-help-enterprises-accelerate-agentic-ai-inference ===
GTC—Oracle and NVIDIA today announced a first-of-its-kind integration between NVIDIA accelerated computing and inference software with Oracle’s AI infrastructure, and generative AI services, to help organizations globally speed creation of agentic AI applications.
The new integration between Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform will make 160+ AI tools and 100+ NVIDIA NIM™ microservices natively available through the OCI Console. In addition, Oracle and NVIDIA are collaborating on the no-code deployment of both Oracle and NVIDIA AI Blueprints and on accelerating AI vector search in Oracle Database 23ai with the NVIDIA cuVS library. 
“Oracle has become the platform of choice for both AI training and inferencing, and this partnership enhances our ability to help customers achieve greater innovation and business results,” said Safra Catz, CEO of Oracle. “NVIDIA’s offerings, paired with OCI’s flexibility, scalability, performance and security, will speed AI adoption and help customers get more value from their data.”
“Oracle and NVIDIA are perfect partners for the age of reasoning — an AI and accelerated computing company working with a key player in processing much of the world’s enterprise data,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Together, we help enterprises innovate with agentic AI to deliver amazing things for their customers and partners.” 
Purpose-Built Solutions to Meet Enterprise AI Needs
Reducing the time it takes to deploy reasoning models, NVIDIA AI Enterprise will be natively available through the OCI Console, enabling customers to quickly and easily access AI tools including NVIDIA NIM — a set of 100+ optimized, cloud-native inference microservices for leading AI models, including the latest NVIDIA Llama Nemotron models for advanced AI reasoning. 
NVIDIA AI Enterprise will be available as a deployment image for OCI bare-metal instances and Kubernetes clusters using OCI Kubernetes Engine. OCI Console customers benefit from direct billing and customer support through Oracle.  
Organizations can deploy OCI’s 150+ AI and cloud services with NVIDIA accelerated computing and NVIDIA AI Enterprise in the data center, the public cloud or at the edge. This offering provides an integrated AI stack to help address data privacy, sovereign AI and low-latency requirements.
Biotechnology company Soley Therapeutics is deploying OCI AI Infrastructure, NVIDIA AI Enterprise and NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs to build its AI drug discovery platform to unlock possible treatments for complex diseases by capturing, decoding and interpreting cellular language to forecast cell fate. 
“We believe in the potential of AI in developing new solutions that can help deliver treatments for cancer and other complex diseases,” said Yerem Yeghiazarians, cofounder and CEO of Soley Therapeutics. “The combination of OCI and NVIDIA delivers a full-stack AI solution, providing us the storage, compute, software tools and support necessary to innovate faster with petabytes of data in developing our AI drug discovery platform.”
AI Deployment at Scale With Tailored Blueprints
OCI AI Blueprints provide no-code deployment recipes that enable customers to quickly run AI workloads without having to make decisions about the software stack or manually provision the infrastructure. The blueprints offer clear hardware recommendations for NVIDIA GPUs, NIM microservices and prepackaged observability tools, helping enterprises accelerate their AI projects from weeks to minutes.  
In addition, NVIDIA Blueprints provide developers with a unified experience across the NVIDIA stack, providing reference workflows for enterprise AI use cases. Using NVIDIA Blueprints, organizations can build and operationalize custom AI applications with NVIDIA AI Enterprise and NVIDIA Omniverse™ software, application programming interfaces and microservices. For example, developers can begin with an NVIDIA AI Blueprint for a customer service AI assistant and customize it for their own use.
To simplify the development, deployment and scale-out of advanced physical AI and simulation applications and workflows, the NVIDIA Omniverse platform and NVIDIA Isaac Sim™ development workstations and Omniverse Kit App Streaming are expected to be available on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Marketplace later this year, preconfigured with compute bare-metal instances accelerated by NVIDIA L40S GPUs.
Pipefy, an AI-powered automation platform for business process management, uses an inference blueprint for document preprocessing and image processing.
“We embraced OCI AI Blueprints to spin up NVIDIA GPU nodes and deploy multimodal large language models quickly for document- and image-processing use cases,” said Gabriel Custodio, principal software engineer at Pipefy. “Using these prepackaged and verified blueprints, deploying our AI models on OCI is now fully automated and significantly faster.”
Real-Time AI Inference With NVIDIA NIM in OCI Data Science
To further accelerate enterprise AI adoption and help enable quick AI deployments with minimal setup, data scientists can access pre-optimized NVIDIA NIM microservices directly in OCI Data Science. This supports real-time AI inference use cases without the complexity of managing infrastructure. 
To help maintain data security and compliance, the models run in the customer’s OCI tenancy. Customers can purchase the models through a flexible, pay-as-you-go, hourly pricing model or apply their Oracle Universal Credits. 
Organizations can use this integration to deploy inference endpoints with preconfigured, optimized NIM inference engines in minutes, rapidly accelerating time to value for use cases such as AI-powered assistants, real-time recommendation engines and copilots. In addition, this allows customers to start using the integration for smaller workloads and seamlessly scale to enterprise-wide deployments. 
NVIDIA Accelerated Computing Platform Turbocharges AI Vector Search in Oracle Database 23ai
Oracle and NVIDIA are working together to accelerate the creation of vector embeddings and vector indexes — compute-intensive portions of AI Vector Search workloads in Oracle Database 23ai — using NVIDIA GPUs and NVIDIA cuVS. 
Organizations can enable vector embedding through bulk vectorization of large volumes of input data such as text, images and videos, as well as the fast creation and maintenance of vector indexes. With NVIDIA-accelerated AI Vector Search, Oracle Database customers can significantly improve the performance of their AI pipelines to help support high-volume AI vector workloads.
DeweyVision provides advanced computer vision and artificial intelligence capabilities to turn media into data, making it accessible, searchable, discoverable, retrievable and actionable. DeweyVision uses Oracle Database 23ai on Oracle Autonomous Database for its AI-powered, no-code warehousing tools.

What does it take to teach robots complex decision-making in the real world? For Nicklas Hansen, a doctoral candidate at UC San Diego and an NVIDIA Graduate Research Fellow, the answer lies in scalable, robust machine learning algorithms.
With experience from the University of California, Berkeley, Meta AI (FAIR) and the Technical University of Denmark, Hansen is pushing the boundaries of how robots perceive, plan and act in dynamic environments. Their research sits at the intersection of robotics, reinforcement learning and computer vision — bridging the gap between simulation and real-world deployment.
Hansen’s recent work tackles one of robotics’ toughest challenges: long-horizon manipulation. Their paper, Multi-Stage Manipulation With Demonstration-Augmented Reward, Policy and World Model Learning, introduces a framework that enhances data efficiency in sparse-reward environments by using multistage task structures.
Another key project of Hansen’s, Hierarchical World Models as Visual Whole-Body Humanoid Controllers, advances control strategies for humanoid robots, enabling more adaptive and humanlike movements.
Beyond their own research, Hansen advocates for making AI-driven robotics more accessible.
“My advice to anyone looking to get started with AI for robotics is to simply play around with the many open-source tools available and gradually start contributing to projects that align with your goals and interests,” they said. “With the availability of free simulation tools like MuJoCo, NVIDIA Isaac Lab and ManiSkill, you can make a profound impact on the field without owning a real robot.”
Hansen is the lead author of TD-MPC2, a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm capable of learning a variety of control tasks without any domain knowledge. The algorithm is open source and can be run on a single consumer-grade GPU.

LAS VEGAS, Jan.  06, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CES -- NVIDIA today announced foundation models running locally on NVIDIA RTX™ AI PCs that supercharge digital humans, content creation, productivity and development. 
These models — offered as NVIDIA NIM™ microservices — are accelerated by new GeForce RTX™ 50 Series GPUs, which feature up to 3,352 trillion operations per second of AI performance and 32GB of VRAM. Built on the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, RTX 50 Series are the first consumer GPUs to add support for FP4 compute, boosting AI inference performance by 2x and enabling generative AI models to run locally in a smaller memory footprint, compared with previous-generation hardware.
GeForce™ has long been a vital platform for AI developers. The first GPU-accelerated deep learning network, AlexNet, was trained on the GeForce GTX™ 580 in 2012 — and last year, over 30% of published AI research papers cited the use of GeForce RTX.
Now, with generative AI and RTX AI PCs, anyone can be a developer. A new wave of low-code and no-code tools, such as AnythingLLM, ComfyUI, Langflow and LM Studio, enable enthusiasts to use AI models in complex workflows via simple graphical user interfaces.
NIM microservices connected to these GUIs will make it effortless to access and deploy the latest generative AI models. NVIDIA AI Blueprints, built on NIM microservices, provide easy-to-use, preconfigured reference workflows for digital humans, content creation and more.
To meet the growing demand from AI developers and enthusiasts, every top PC manufacturer and system builder is launching NIM-ready RTX AI PCs with GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs.
“AI is advancing at light speed, from perception AI to generative AI and now agentic AI,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “NIM microservices and AI Blueprints give PC developers and enthusiasts the building blocks to explore the magic of AI.”
Making AI NIMbleFoundation models — neural networks trained on immense amounts of raw data — are the building blocks for generative AI.
NVIDIA will release a pipeline of NIM microservices for RTX AI PCs from top model developers such as Black Forest Labs, Meta, Mistral and Stability AI. Use cases span large language models (LLMs), vision language models, image generation, speech, embedding models for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), PDF extraction and computer vision.
“GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs with FP4 compute will unlock a massive range of models that can run on PC, which were previously limited to large data centers,” said Robin Rombach, CEO of Black Forest Labs. “Making FLUX an NVIDIA NIM microservice increases the rate at which AI can be deployed and experienced by more users, while delivering incredible performance.”
NVIDIA today also announced the Llama Nemotron family of open models that provide high accuracy on a wide range of agentic tasks. The Llama Nemotron Nano model will be offered as a NIM microservice for RTX AI PCs and workstations, and excels at agentic AI tasks like instruction following, function calling, chat, coding and math.
NIM microservices include the key components for running AI on PCs and are optimized for deployment across NVIDIA GPUs — whether in RTX PCs and workstations or in the cloud.
Developers and enthusiasts will be able to quickly download, set up and run these NIM microservices on Windows 11 PCs with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
“AI is driving Windows 11 PC innovation at a rapid rate, and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) offers a great cross-platform environment for AI development on Windows 11 alongside Windows Copilot Runtime,” said Pavan Davuluri, corporate vice president of Windows at Microsoft. “NVIDIA NIM microservices, optimized for Windows PCs, give developers and enthusiasts ready-to-integrate AI models for their Windows apps, further accelerating deployment of AI capabilities to Windows users.”
The NIM microservices, running on RTX AI PCs, will be compatible with top AI development and agent frameworks, including AI Toolkit for VSCode, AnythingLLM, ComfyUI, CrewAI, Flowise AI, LangChain, Langflow and LM Studio. Developers can connect applications and workflows built on these frameworks to AI models running NIM microservices through industry-standard endpoints, enabling them to use the latest technology with a unified interface across the cloud, data centers, workstations and PCs.
Enthusiasts will also be able to experience a range of NIM microservices using an upcoming release of the NVIDIA ChatRTX tech demo.
Putting a Face on Agentic AITo demonstrate how enthusiasts and developers can use NIM to build AI agents and assistants, NVIDIA today previewed Project R2X, a vision-enabled PC avatar that can put information at a user’s fingertips, assist with desktop apps and video conference calls, read and summarize documents, and more.
The avatar is rendered using NVIDIA RTX Neural Faces, a new generative AI algorithm that augments traditional rasterization with entirely generated pixels. The face is then animated by a new diffusion-based NVIDIA Audio2Face™-3D model that improves lip and tongue movement. R2X can be connected to cloud AI services such as OpenAI’s GPT4o and xAI’s Grok, and NIM microservices and AI Blueprints, such as PDF retrievers or alternative LLMs, via developer frameworks such as CrewAI, Flowise AI and Langflow. Sign up for Project R2X updates.
AI Blueprints Coming to PCNIM microservices are also available to PC users through AI Blueprints — reference AI workflows that can run locally on RTX PCs. With these blueprints, developers can create podcasts from PDF documents, generate stunning images guided by 3D scenes and more.
The blueprint for PDF to podcast extracts text, images and tables from a PDF to create a podcast script that can be edited by users. It can also generate a full audio recording from the script using voices available in the blueprint or based on a user’s voice sample. In addition, users can have a real-time conversation with the AI podcast host to learn more about specific topics.
The blueprint uses NIM microservices like Mistral-Nemo-12B-Instruct for language, NVIDIA Riva for text-to-speech and automatic speech recognition, and the NeMo Retriever collection of microservices for PDF extraction.
The AI Blueprint for 3D-guided generative AI gives artists finer control over image generation. While AI can generate amazing images from simple text prompts, controlling image composition using only words can be challenging. With this blueprint, creators can use simple 3D objects laid out in a 3D renderer like Blender to guide AI image generation. The artist can create 3D assets by hand or generate them using AI, place them in the scene and set the 3D viewport camera. Then, a prepackaged workflow powered by the FLUX NIM microservice will use the current composition to generate high-quality images that match the 3D scene.
NVIDIA NIM microservices and AI Blueprints will be available starting in February with initial hardware support for GeForce RTX 50 Series, GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080, and NVIDIA RTX 6000 and 5000 professional GPUs. Additional GPUs will be supported in the future.
NIM-ready RTX AI PCs will be available from Acer, ASUS, Dell, GIGABYTE, HP, Lenovo, MSI, Razer and Samsung, and from local system builders Corsair, Falcon Northwest, LDLC, Maingear, Mifcon, Origin PC, PCS and Scan.

LAS VEGAS, Jan.  06, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CES— NVIDIA today announced NVIDIA Cosmos™, a platform comprising state-of-the-art generative world foundation models, advanced tokenizers, guardrails and an accelerated video processing pipeline built to advance the development of physical AI systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and robots.
Physical AI models are costly to develop, and require vast amounts of real-world data and testing. Cosmos world foundation models, or WFMs, offer developers an easy way to generate massive amounts of photoreal, physics-based synthetic data to train and evaluate their existing models. Developers can also build custom models by fine-tuning Cosmos WFMs.
Cosmos models will be available under an open model license to accelerate the work of the robotics and AV community. Developers can preview the first models on the NVIDIA API catalog, or download the family of models and fine-tuning framework from the NVIDIA NGC™ catalog or Hugging Face.
Leading robotics and automotive companies, including 1X, Agile Robots, Agility, Figure AI, Foretellix, Fourier, Galbot, Hillbot, IntBot, Neura Robotics, Skild AI, Virtual Incision, Waabi and XPENG, along with ridesharing giant Uber, are among the first to adopt Cosmos.
“The ChatGPT moment for robotics is coming. Like large language models, world foundation models are fundamental to advancing robot and AV development, yet not all developers have the expertise and resources to train their own,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “We created Cosmos to democratize physical AI and put general robotics in reach of every developer.”
Open World Foundation Models to Accelerate the Next Wave of AINVIDIA Cosmos’ suite of open models means developers can customize the WFMs with datasets, such as video recordings of AV trips or robots navigating a warehouse, according to the needs of their target application.
Cosmos WFMs are purpose-built for physical AI research and development, and can generate physics-based videos from a combination of inputs, like text, image and video, as well as robot sensor or motion data. The models are built for physically based interactions, object permanence, and high-quality generation of simulated industrial environments — like warehouses or factories — and of driving environments, including various road conditions.
In his opening keynote at CES, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang showcased ways physical AI developers can use Cosmos models, including for:
Advanced World Model Development ToolsBuilding physical AI models requires petabytes of video data and tens of thousands of compute hours to process, curate and label that data. To help save enormous costs in data curation, training and model customization, Cosmos features:
World’s Largest Physical AI Industries Adopt Cosmos Pioneers across the physical AI industry are already adopting Cosmos technologies.
1X, an AI and humanoid robot company, launched the 1X World Model Challenge dataset using Cosmos Tokenizer. XPENG will use Cosmos to accelerate the development of its humanoid robot. And Hillbot and Skild AI are using Cosmos to fast-track the development of their general-purpose robots.
“Data scarcity and variability are key challenges to successful learning in robot environments,” said Pras Velagapudi, chief technology officer at Agility. “Cosmos’ text-, image- and video-to-world capabilities allow us to generate and augment photorealistic scenarios for a variety of tasks that we can use to train models without needing as much expensive, real-world data capture.”
Transportation leaders are also using Cosmos to build physical AI for AVs:
“Generative AI will power the future of mobility, requiring both rich data and very powerful compute,” said Dara Khosrowshahi, CEO of Uber. “By working with NVIDIA, we are confident that we can help supercharge the timeline for safe and scalable autonomous driving solutions for the industry.”
Developing Open, Safe and Responsible AINVIDIA Cosmos was developed in line with NVIDIA’s trustworthy AI principles, which prioritize privacy, safety, security, transparency and reducing unwanted bias.
Trustworthy AI is essential for fostering innovation within the developer community and maintaining user trust. NVIDIA is committed to safe and trustworthy AI, in line with the White House’s voluntary AI commitments and other global AI safety initiatives.
The open Cosmos platform includes guardrails designed to mitigate harmful text and images, and features a tool to enhance text prompts for accuracy. Videos generated with Cosmos autoregressive and diffusion models on the NVIDIA API catalog include invisible watermarks to identify AI-generated content, helping reduce the chances of misinformation and misattribution.
NVIDIA encourages developers to adopt trustworthy AI practices and further enhance guardrail and watermarking solutions for their applications.
Availability
Cosmos WFMs are now available under NVIDIA’s open model license on Hugging Face and the NVIDIA NGC catalog. Cosmos models will soon be available as fully optimized NVIDIA NIM microservices.
Developers can access NVIDIA NeMo Curator for accelerated video processing and customize their own world models with NVIDIA NeMo. NVIDIA DGX Cloud offers a fast and easy way to deploy these models, with enterprise support available through the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform.
NVIDIA also announced new NVIDIA Llama Nemotron large language models and NVIDIA Cosmos Nemotron vision language models that developers can use for enterprise AI use cases in healthcare, financial services, manufacturing and more.

SAN JOSE, Calif., March  18, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- Building on their longstanding partnership, NVIDIA, Alphabet and Google today announced new initiatives to advance AI, democratize access to AI tools, speed the development of physical AI and transform industries including healthcare, manufacturing and energy.
Engineers and researchers throughout Alphabet are working closely with technical teams at NVIDIA to use AI and simulation to develop robots with grasping skills, reimagine drug discovery, optimize energy grids and more. Employing the NVIDIA Omniverse™, NVIDIA Cosmos™ and NVIDIA Isaac™ platforms, teams from Google DeepMind, Isomorphic Labs, Intrinsic and X’s moonshot Tapestry will discuss milestones from their respective collaborations at the NVIDIA GTC global AI conference.
To power research and AI production efforts for its customers, Alphabet’s Google Cloud will be among the first to adopt the NVIDIA GB300 NVL72 rack-scale solution and NVIDIA RTX PRO™ 6000 Blackwell Server Edition GPU, also announced today at GTC.
NVIDIA will be the first industry partner to adopt SynthID, a Google DeepMind AI technology that embeds digital watermarks directly into AI-generated images, audio, text or video.
“I’m proud of our ongoing and deep partnership with NVIDIA, which spans the early days of Android and our cutting-edge AI collaborations across Alphabet,” said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and Alphabet. “I’m really excited about the next phase of our partnership as we work together on agentic AI, robotics and bringing the benefits of AI to more people around the world.”
“Alphabet and NVIDIA have a longstanding partnership that extends from building AI infrastructure and software to advancing the use of AI in the largest industries,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “It’s a great joy to see Google and NVIDIA researchers and engineers collaborate to solve incredible challenges, from drug discovery to robotics.”
Developing Responsible AI and Open ModelsGoogle DeepMind and NVIDIA are working to build trust in generative AI through content transparency.
NVIDIA will be the first external user of Google DeepMind’s SynthID, which embeds digital watermarks directly into AI-generated images, audio, text and video. SynthID helps preserve the integrity of outputs from NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation models, available on build.nvidia.com, helping to safeguard against misinformation and misattribution — all without compromising video quality.
Google DeepMind and NVIDIA also partnered to optimize Gemma, Google’s family of lightweight, open models, to run on NVIDIA GPUs. The recent launch of Gemma 3 marks a significant leap forward for open innovation.
NVIDIA has played a key role in making Gemma even more accessible for developers. Supercharged by the NVIDIA AI platform, Gemma is available as a highly optimized NVIDIA NIM™ microservice, harnessing the power of the open-source NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM library for exceptional inference performance.
In addition, this deep engineering collaboration will extend to optimizing Gemini-based workloads on NVIDIA accelerated computing via Vertex AI.
The Age of Intelligent RobotsIntrinsic is an Alphabet company focused on making intelligently adaptive AI for robotics usable and valuable for manufacturers across industries. Today, the majority of the world’s installed industrial robots are manually programmed, with every movement hard-coded in a complex, expensive process.
Partnering with NVIDIA, the teams have built deeper and more intuitive developer workflows for Intrinsic Flowstate to support NVIDIA Isaac Manipulator foundation models for a universal robot grasping capability. Using foundation models for robotics will significantly reduce application development time and improve flexibility, with AI that can adapt effortlessly.

=== ARTICLE FROM: https://www.tipranks.com/news/why-it-may-be-time-to-start-averaging-into-nvidia-stock-nvda?utm_source=edition.cnn.com&utm_medium=referral ===
Nvidia is leading the AI boom. Despite a high valuation, averaging in makes sense amid recession fears. With long-term growth looking strong and Wall Street strongly bullish, getting in at current levels is worthy of consideration.
Nvidia (NVDA) sits on a throne few tech companies ever reachâthe undisputed king of artificial intelligence (AI). With record-breaking sales of its Blackwell chips and a growing ecosystem of strategic investments in AI infrastructure firms, Nvidia is expanding well beyond chipmaking. Itâs beginning to resemble Berkshire Hathaway, not in corporate structure but in stature: a foundational player set to capture value across an entire economic shift.
Despite a towering valuationâtrading at ~20x sales, with a $2.6 trillion market cap, and hot on the heels of a tariff-induced discountânow may be the right time to consider tranching into Nvidia stock. I’m stoutly bullish on NVDA, with recent tariff-induced declines allowing entry at lower levels. Averaging gradually can help investors navigate short-term volatility and recession risks while building exposure to what may be the defining stock of the AI era.
The current AI boom isnât just another cycle or sector rotationâitâs a generational megatrend. AI demands enormous computational horsepower, and Nvidia is delivering the engines. The company recently wrapped up FY2025 with a financial performance thatâs hard to overstate. Revenue surged 114% year-over-year, reaching a staggering $130 billion. The bulk of this was driven by Nvidiaâs Data Center segment, which has become the companyâs AI flagship. Profitability has followed suit. Gross margins soared to around 75%, while net income reached a jaw-dropping $73 billion for the year. Even by Silicon Valley standards, NVDA’s performance is market-beating.
NVDA’s results in Q4 FY2025 were particularly impressive. Nvidia pulled in $39.3 billion in revenueâa 78% annual increase. Of that, $11 billion came from the companyâs Blackwell chips, which have become the fastest-selling product in its history. Nvidia is also expanding its AI ecosystem. Itâs partnered with CoreWeave (CRWV), a GPU cloud provider Nvidia has invested in, and acquired a stake in Nebius (NBIS), a European AI cloud spinout from Yandex. These moves suggest Nvidia is strategically broadening its reach within the AI infrastructure space and acting like an AI capital allocator.
Looking ahead, growth seems poised to continue. Nvidia has guided for $43 billion in revenue in Q1 2026. CEO Jensen Huang recently stated that this phase of AI is âjust the beginning,â pointing to the companyâs pivot toward âreasoning AIâ and âagentic AIââthe next evolution in artificial intelligence.
For long-term investors, the key question isnât whether Nvidia is inexpensive today. The better question is whether Nvidia can grow fast enough to justify its current valuation. My base-case view assumes normalized earnings per share (EPS) of $4.50 over the next year. A forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35 puts the stock at roughly $157.50âan increase of nearly 45% from todayâs level.
There are risks to the bullish thesis, to be sure. Tariffs and trade policy remain unresolved, particularly with China. Meanwhile, the broader macroeconomic outlook remains fragile. But for those with a long-term horizon, Nvidiaâs position as the linchpin of the AI economy makes it a compelling candidate for portfolio exposure to big tech themes. As Warren Buffett has famously advised, “Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.â In this case, a bit of greed may be warranted.
In many respects, NVDA stock is largely de-risked and remains exposed to factors that affect everyone else. If the U.S. economy enters a deep recession, the stock will likely take a further hit along with the broader market. Thatâs why a tranching strategy makes sense. By buying graduallyâsay, monthly or quarterlyâyou reduce the risk of buying before a steeper decline and gain the advantage of averaging your entry price over time.
You donât need to perfectly time the bottom. Instead, you build conviction over time in a company you believe has extraordinary long-term potential. If Nvidia becomes the equivalent of Berkshire Hathaway for the AI industry, those who dollar-cost-averaged into the stock during periods of uncertainty may look back with satisfaction.
As for recession risk, itâs anyoneâs guess. The macro environment is volatile, and policy decisions are shifting frequently in the Trump era. To mitigate risk, Iâve reduced my cash position from 30% to ~22% after recent market dips. However, if equities drop by another 15-30%, Iâll likely cut my cash exposure to as low as 10% to seize emerging opportunities.
On Wall Street, NVDA stock carries a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 37 Buy, four Hold, and zero Sell ratings over the past three months. NVDAâs average price target of $174.06 implies ~62% upside potential over the next twelve months.
This week, Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley reiterated his Buy rating, projecting a 50% upside over the coming year. That kind of confidence from institutional analysts adds weight to the long-term bull case.
Investing is never easy. Thereâs no magic formula for perfect timing, nor any crystal ball to tell us when a recession will hit or what global policy will look like next quarter. But you can stack the odds in your favor by focusing on generational trends like AI and building a cyclically resilient portfolio.
That starts with holding cash during market froth and deploying it during moments of fear. In Nvidiaâs case, this company will likely be studied in business schools for decades. The best time to buy was two years ago when early investors saw two-year returns as high as 1,000%. However, today’s investors are potentially entering a new growth phase, and picking the right horse is never easy.
Returns moving forward probably wonât be as dramatic, but they could still be significant. Nvidia is at the forefront of modernizing entire industriesâfrom healthcare to automotive, finance to manufacturingâall through AI. For investors willing to take a long view and deploy capital thoughtfully, Nvidia offers a rare mix of explosive growth potential and real staying power.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., March  13, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NVIDIA today announced ahead of the Game Developers Conference (GDC) groundbreaking enhancements to NVIDIA RTX™ neural rendering technologies.
NVIDIA has partnered with Microsoft to bring neural shading support to the Microsoft DirectX preview in April, giving developers access to AI Tensor Cores in NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ GPUs to accelerate neural networks from within a game’s graphics pipeline.
Neural shading represents a revolution in graphics programming, combining AI with traditional rendering to dramatically boost frame rates, enhance image quality and reduce system resource usage.
“Microsoft is adding cooperative vector support to DirectX and HLSL, starting with a preview this April,” said Shawn Hargreaves, Direct3D development manager at Microsoft. “This will advance the future of graphics programming by enabling neural rendering across the gaming industry. Unlocking Tensor Cores on NVIDIA RTX will allow developers to fully leverage RTX Neural Shaders for richer, more immersive experiences on Windows.”
In addition, NVIDIA RTX Kit, a suite of neural rendering technologies for game developers, is receiving major updates with Unreal Engine 5 support for the RTX Mega Geometry and RTX Hair features.
Enabling modders to create stunning remasters of classic games, the NVIDIA RTX Remix open-source platform officially released today. Plus, a new playable Half-Life 2 RTX demo featuring the latest neural rendering enhancements — such as full ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, RTX Neural Radiance Cache, RTX Skin and more — will be available on Tuesday, March 18.
NVIDIA is also celebrating a major milestone with over 100 DLSS 4 games and apps now available.
RTX Kit Arrives in Unreal Engine 5The number of triangles used to create games has increased exponentially over the past three decades. With the introduction of the Unreal Engine 5 Nanite geometry system, developers can build open worlds filled with hundreds of millions of triangles.
As ray-traced game scenes explode in geometric complexity, however, the cost of ray tracing grows exponentially, making it impossible to achieve real-time frame rates. RTX Mega Geometry accelerates ray tracing of scenes with complex geometry, enabling developers to use up to 100x more triangles than today’s standard. RTX Mega Geometry is coming to developers from the NVIDIA RTX (NvRTX) branch of Unreal Engine 5.
NVIDIA GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs introduced RTX Hair, a linear swept sphere primitive that offers a major advancement for accelerating the ray tracing of hair and fur. Replacing typical triangle primitives, linear swept spheres more accurately represent individual strands of hair, improving image quality and performance in rendering realistic digital humans. RTX Hair is coming to the NvRTX branch of Unreal Engine 5.
At the CES trade show, NVIDIA showcased neural rendering capabilities through its “Zorah” technology demo. At GDC, an updated Zorah demo built in Unreal Engine 5 features the latest advancements in neural rendering, including RTX Mega Geometry, RTX Hair, ReSTIR Path Tracing and ReSTIR Direct Illumination.
Return to ‘Half-Life 2’ With RTX DemoThe official release of RTX Remix — featuring DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, a host of new RTX neural rendering technologies and numerous community-requested upgrades — lets modders deliver stunning RTX remasters with even better image quality and higher frame rates.
A year ago, NVIDIA released RTX Remix in beta, enabling remasters of classic games with fully ray-traced lighting, enhanced materials and the latest RTX technologies.
Over 30,000 modders have since used the platform to mod hundreds of classic titles, and over 1 million gamers have played RTX Remix mods such as NVIDIA Lightspeed Studios’ Portal with RTX and the modder-made Portal: Prelude RTX.
Half-Life 2 owners can experience the capabilities of RTX Remix across the environments of Ravenholm and Nova Prospekt by downloading a free Half-Life 2 RTX demo from Steam starting March 18.
The remaster is being developed by four of Half-Life 2’s top mod teams, working together under the banner of Orbifold Studios. Half-Life 2 RTX features full ray tracing, remastered assets, DLSS 4, NVIDIA Reflex, RTX Neural Radiance Cache, RTX Skin and RTX Volumetrics.
Over 100 DLSS 4 Games and Apps Out NowDLSS 4 was introduced with the release of GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, receiving an incredible response from gamers and rapidly adopted by game developers. It is now supported in over 100 games and apps, reaching this milestone two years quicker than DLSS 3 to become the most rapidly adopted NVIDIA game technology of all time.
DLSS 4 debuted Multi Frame Generation, which uses AI to generate up to three additional frames per traditionally rendered frame, working with the complete suite of DLSS technologies to multiply frame rates by up to 8x over traditional rendering. This massive performance improvement on GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards and laptops enables gamers to max out visuals at the highest resolutions and play at incredible frame rates.
In addition, Lost Soul Aside, Mecha BREAK, Phantom Blade Zero, Stellar Blade, Tides of Annihilation and Wild Assault will launch with DLSS 4, giving GeForce RTX gamers the definitive PC experience in each title.

SAN JOSE, Calif., March  18, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- NVIDIA today announced a collaboration with GE HealthCare to advance innovation in autonomous imaging, focused on developing autonomous X-ray technologies and ultrasound applications.
Building autonomy into systems like X-ray and ultrasound requires medical imaging systems to understand and operate in the physical world. This enables the automation of complex workflows such as patient placement, image scanning and quality checking.
To accomplish this, GE HealthCare, a pioneering partner, is using the new NVIDIA Isaac™ for Healthcare medical device simulation platform, which includes pretrained models and physics-based simulations of sensors, anatomy and environments. The platform accelerates research and development workflows, enabling GE HealthCare to train, test and validate autonomous imaging system capabilities in a virtual environment before deployment in the physical world.
“The healthcare industry is one of the most important applications of AI, as the demand for healthcare services far exceeds the supply,” said Kimberly Powell, vice president of healthcare at NVIDIA. “We are working with an industry leader, GE HealthCare, to deliver Isaac for Healthcare, three computers to give lifesaving medical devices the ability to act autonomously and extend access to healthcare globally.”
Expanding Access to Imaging With Physical AI  Ultrasounds and X-ray are the most common and widely used diagnostic imaging systems, yet nearly two-thirds of the global population lack access. Enhancing imaging systems with robotic capabilities will help expand access to care.
NVIDIA and GE HealthCare have been working together for nearly two decades, building innovative image-reconstruction techniques across CT and MRI, image-guided therapy and mammography.
“GE HealthCare is committed to developing innovative technologies that redefine and enhance patient care,” said Roland Rott, president and CEO of Imaging at GE HealthCare. “We look forward to taking advantage of physical AI for autonomous imaging systems with NVIDIA technology to improve patient access and address the challenges of growing workloads and staffing shortages in healthcare.”
Isaac for Healthcare Closes Gap Between Simulation and Reality  NVIDIA will also support other customers with Isaac for Healthcare for use cases including simulation environments. Simulation environments enable robotic systems to safely learn skills in a physically accurate virtual environment for real-world situations, such as surgery, that would otherwise be impossible to replicate.
Isaac for Healthcare is a physical AI platform built on NVIDIA’s three computers for robotics: NVIDIA DGX™, NVIDIA Omniverse™ and NVIDIA Holoscan. It includes AI models fine-tuned for healthcare robotics that can understand, act and see using enhanced vision and language processing. It also has a simulation framework for developers to accurately simulate medical environments and provides seamless deployment on NVIDIA Holoscan, an edge AI computing platform, to power robotic decision-making in the real world, in real time.
Simulation options for medical sensors are often limited. With Isaac for Healthcare, developers can now access physics-based digital twins of medical environments, allowing them to import custom sensors, instruments and even anatomies to teach robots how to respond to various scenarios. These virtual environments help close the gap between simulation and real-world implementation, and enable rapid digital prototyping.
Isaac for Healthcare allows for multi-scale simulation ranging from microscopic structures and surgery suites to full hospital facilities. Easy policy training in simulation allows robotic systems to learn how to respond in various medical scenarios in the operating room, and how to best support physician decision-making and patient care.
Healthcare Robotics Ecosystem Rapidly Expands  Isaac for Healthcare can help speed the development of robotic healthcare solutions by simulating complex medical scenarios, training AI models and optimizing robotic applications like surgery, endoscopy and cardiovascular interventions. Early adopters include Moon Surgical, Neptune Medical and Xcath.
Isaac for Healthcare is enabling ecosystem partners to seamlessly integrate their simulation tools, sensors, robot systems and medical probes into a domain-specific simulation environment. Among early ecosystem partners are Ansys, Franka, ImFusion, Kinova and Kuka.
Issac for Healthcare is now available in early access.

SAN JOSE, Calif., March  18, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- NVIDIA today unveiled NVIDIA Dynamo, an open-source inference software for accelerating and scaling AI reasoning models in AI factories at the lowest cost and with the highest efficiency.
Efficiently orchestrating and coordinating AI inference requests across a large fleet of GPUs is crucial to ensuring that AI factories run at the lowest possible cost to maximize token revenue generation.
As AI reasoning goes mainstream, every AI model will generate tens of thousands of tokens used to “think” with every prompt. Increasing inference performance while continually lowering the cost of inference accelerates growth and boosts revenue opportunities for service providers.
NVIDIA Dynamo, the successor to NVIDIA Triton Inference Server™, is new AI inference-serving software designed to maximize token revenue generation for AI factories deploying reasoning AI models. It orchestrates and accelerates inference communication across thousands of GPUs, and uses disaggregated serving to separate the processing and generation phases of large language models (LLMs) on different GPUs. This allows each phase to be optimized independently for its specific needs and ensures maximum GPU resource utilization.
“Industries around the world are training AI models to think and learn in different ways, making them more sophisticated over time,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “To enable a future of custom reasoning AI, NVIDIA Dynamo helps serve these models at scale, driving cost savings and efficiencies across AI factories.”
Using the same number of GPUs, Dynamo doubles the performance and revenue of AI factories serving Llama models on today’s NVIDIA Hopper™ platform. When running the DeepSeek-R1 model on a large cluster of GB200 NVL72 racks, NVIDIA Dynamo’s intelligent inference optimizations also boost the number of tokens generated by over 30x per GPU.
To achieve these inference performance improvements, NVIDIA Dynamo incorporates features that enable it to increase throughput and reduce costs. It can dynamically add, remove and reallocate GPUs in response to fluctuating request volumes and types, as well as pinpoint specific GPUs in large clusters that can minimize response computations and route queries. It can also offload inference data to more affordable memory and storage devices and quickly retrieve them when needed, minimizing inference costs.
NVIDIA Dynamo is fully open source and supports PyTorch, SGLang, NVIDIA TensorRT™-LLM and vLLM to allow enterprises, startups and researchers to develop and optimize ways to serve AI models across disaggregated inference. It will enable users to accelerate the adoption of AI inference, including at AWS, Cohere, CoreWeave, Dell, Fireworks, Google Cloud, Lambda, Meta, Microsoft Azure, Nebius, NetApp, OCI, Perplexity, Together AI and VAST. 
Inference Supercharged NVIDIA Dynamo maps the knowledge that inference systems hold in memory from serving prior requests — known as KV cache — across potentially thousands of GPUs.
It then routes new inference requests to the GPUs that have the best knowledge match, avoiding costly recomputations and freeing up GPUs to respond to new incoming requests.
“To handle hundreds of millions of requests monthly, we rely on NVIDIA GPUs and inference software to deliver the performance, reliability and scale our business and users demand,” said Denis Yarats, chief technology officer of Perplexity AI. “We look forward to leveraging Dynamo, with its enhanced distributed serving capabilities, to drive even more inference-serving efficiencies and meet the compute demands of new AI reasoning models.”
Agentic AI AI provider Cohere is planning to power agentic AI capabilities in its Command series of models using NVIDIA Dynamo.
“Scaling advanced AI models requires sophisticated multi-GPU scheduling, seamless coordination and low-latency communication libraries that transfer reasoning contexts seamlessly across memory and storage,” said Saurabh Baji, senior vice president of engineering at Cohere. “We expect NVIDIA Dynamo will help us deliver a premier user experience to our enterprise customers.”
Disaggregated ServingThe NVIDIA Dynamo inference platform also supports disaggregated serving, which assigns the different computational phases of LLMs — including building an understanding of the user query and then generating the best response — to different GPUs. This approach is ideal for reasoning models like the new NVIDIA Llama Nemotron model family, which uses advanced inference techniques for improved contextual understanding and response generation. Disaggregated serving allows each phase to be fine-tuned and resourced independently, improving throughput and delivering faster responses to users.
Together AI, the AI Acceleration Cloud, is looking to integrate its proprietary Together Inference Engine with NVIDIA Dynamo to enable seamless scaling of inference workloads across GPU nodes. This also lets Together AI dynamically address traffic bottlenecks at various stages of the model pipeline.
“Scaling reasoning models cost effectively requires new advanced inference techniques, including disaggregated serving and context-aware routing,” said Ce Zhang, chief technology officer of Together AI. “Together AI provides industry-leading performance using our proprietary inference engine. The openness and modularity of NVIDIA Dynamo will allow us to seamlessly plug its components into our engine to serve more requests while optimizing resource utilization — maximizing our accelerated computing investment. We’re excited to leverage the platform’s breakthrough capabilities to cost-effectively bring open-source reasoning models to our users.”
NVIDIA Dynamo Unpacked NVIDIA Dynamo includes four key innovations that reduce inference serving costs and improve user experience:
NVIDIA Dynamo will be made available in NVIDIA NIM™ microservices and supported in a future release by the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform with production-grade security, support and stability.

LAS VEGAS, Jan.  06, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CES -- NVIDIA today unveiled the most advanced consumer GPUs for gamers, creators and developers — the GeForce RTX™ 50 Series Desktop and Laptop GPUs.
Powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture, fifth-generation Tensor Cores and fourth-generation RT Cores, the GeForce RTX 50 Series delivers breakthroughs in AI-driven rendering, including neural shaders, digital human technologies, geometry and lighting.
“Blackwell, the engine of AI, has arrived for PC gamers, developers and creatives,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Fusing AI-driven neural rendering and ray tracing, Blackwell is the most significant computer graphics innovation since we introduced programmable shading 25 years ago.”
The GeForce RTX 5090 GPU — the fastest GeForce RTX GPU to date — features 92 billion transistors, providing over 3,352 trillion AI operations per second (TOPS) of computing power. Blackwell architecture innovations and DLSS 4 mean the GeForce RTX 5090 GPU outperforms the GeForce RTX 4090 GPU by up to 2x.
GeForce Blackwell comes to laptops with all the features of desktop models, bringing a considerable upgrade to portable computing, including extraordinary graphics capabilities and remarkable efficiency. The Blackwell generation of NVIDIA Max-Q technology extends battery life by up to 40%, and includes thin and light laptops that maintain their sleek design without sacrificing power or performance.
NVIDIA DLSS 4 Boosts Performance by Up to 8xDLSS 4 debuts Multi Frame Generation to boost frame rates by using AI to generate up to three frames per rendered frame. It works in unison with the suite of DLSS technologies to increase performance by up to 8x over traditional rendering, while maintaining responsiveness with NVIDIA Reflex technology.
DLSS 4 also introduces the graphics industry’s first real-time application of the transformer model architecture. Transformer-based DLSS Ray Reconstruction and Super Resolution models use 2x more parameters and 4x more compute to provide greater stability, reduced ghosting, higher details and enhanced anti-aliasing in game scenes. DLSS 4 will be supported on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs in over 75 games and applications the day of launch.
NVIDIA Reflex 2 introduces Frame Warp, an innovative technique to reduce latency in games by updating a rendered frame based on the latest mouse input just before it is sent to the display. Reflex 2 can reduce latency by up to 75%. This gives gamers a competitive edge in multiplayer games and makes single-player titles more responsive.
Blackwell Brings AI to ShadersTwenty-five years ago, NVIDIA introduced GeForce 3 and programmable shaders, which set the stage for two decades of graphics innovation, from pixel shading to compute shading to real-time ray tracing. Alongside GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs, NVIDIA is introducing RTX Neural Shaders, which brings small AI networks into programmable shaders, unlocking film-quality materials, lighting and more in real-time games.
Rendering game characters is one of the most challenging tasks in real-time graphics, as people are prone to notice the smallest errors or artifacts in digital humans. RTX Neural Faces takes a simple rasterized face and 3D pose data as input, and uses generative AI to render a temporally stable, high-quality digital face in real time.
RTX Neural Faces is complemented by new RTX technologies for ray-traced hair and skin. Along with the new RTX Mega Geometry, which enables up to 100x more ray-traced triangles in a scene, these advancements are poised to deliver a massive leap in realism for game characters and environments.
The power of neural rendering, DLSS 4 and the new DLSS transformer model is showcased on GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs with Zorah, a groundbreaking new technology demo from NVIDIA.
Autonomous Game CharactersGeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs bring industry-leading AI TOPS to power autonomous game characters in parallel with game rendering.
NVIDIA is introducing a suite of new NVIDIA ACE technologies that enable game characters to perceive, plan and act like human players. ACE-powered autonomous characters are being integrated into KRAFTON’s PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS and InZOI, the publisher’s upcoming life simulation game, as well as Wemade Next’s MIR5.
In PUBG, companions powered by NVIDIA ACE plan and execute strategic actions, dynamically working with human players to ensure survival. InZOI features Smart Zoi characters that autonomously adjust behaviors based on life goals and in-game events. In MIR5, large language model (LLM)-driven raid bosses adapt tactics based on player behavior, creating more dynamic, challenging encounters.
AI Foundation Models for RTX AI PCsShowcasing how RTX enthusiasts and developers can use NVIDIA NIM microservices to build AI agents and assistants, NVIDIA will release a pipeline of NIM microservices and AI Blueprints for RTX AI PCs from top model developers such as Black Forest Labs, Meta, Mistral and Stability AI.
Use cases span LLMs, vision language models, image generation, speech, embedding models for retrieval-augmented generation, PDF extraction and computer vision. The NIM microservices include all the necessary components for running AI on PCs and are optimized for deployment across all NVIDIA GPUs.
To demonstrate how enthusiasts and developers can use NIM to build AI agents and assistants, NVIDIA today previewed Project R2X, a vision-enabled PC avatar that can put information at a user’s fingertips, assist with desktop apps and video conference calls, read and summarize documents, and more.
AI-Powered Tools for CreatorsThe GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs supercharge creative workflows. RTX 50 Series GPUs are the first consumer GPUs to support FP4 precision, boosting AI image generation performance for models such as FLUX by 2x and enabling generative AI models to run locally in a smaller memory footprint, compared with previous-generation hardware.
The NVIDIA Broadcast app gains two AI-powered beta features for livestreamers: Studio Voice, which upgrades microphone audio, and Virtual Key Light, which relights faces for polished streams. Streamlabs is introducing the Intelligent Streaming Assistant, powered by NVIDIA ACE and Inworld AI, which acts as a cohost, producer and technical assistant to enhance livestreams.

SAN JOSE, Calif., March  18, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC—NVIDIA today announced a major release of new NVIDIA Cosmos™ world foundation models (WFMs), introducing an open and fully customizable reasoning model for physical AI development and giving developers unprecedented control over world generation.
NVIDIA is also launching two new blueprints — powered by the NVIDIA Omniverse™ and Cosmos platforms — that provide developers with massive, controllable synthetic data generation engines for post-training robots and autonomous vehicles.
Industry leaders including 1X, Agility Robotics, Figure AI, Foretellix, Skild AI and Uber are among the first to adopt Cosmos to generate richer training data for physical AI faster and at scale.
“Just as large language models revolutionized generative and agentic AI, Cosmos world foundation models are a breakthrough for physical AI,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Cosmos introduces an open and fully customizable reasoning model for physical AI and unlocks opportunities for step-function advances in robotics and the physical industries.”
Cosmos Transfer for Synthetic Data GenerationCosmos Transfer WFMs ingest structured video inputs such as segmentation maps, depth maps, lidar scans, pose estimation maps and trajectory maps to generate controllable photoreal video outputs.
Cosmos Transfer streamlines perception AI training, transforming 3D simulations or ground truth created in Omniverse into photorealistic videos for large-scale, controllable synthetic data generation.
Agility Robotics will be an early adopter of Cosmos Transfer and Omniverse for large-scale synthetic data generation to train its robot models.
“Cosmos offers us an opportunity to scale our photorealistic training data beyond what we can feasibly collect in the real world,” said Pras Velagapudi, chief technology officer of Agility Robotics. “We’re excited to see what new performance we can unlock with the platform, while making the most use of the physics-based simulation data we already have.”
The NVIDIA Omniverse Blueprint for autonomous vehicle simulation uses Cosmos Transfer to amplify variations of physically based sensor data. With the blueprint, Foretellix can enhance behavioral scenarios by varying conditions like weather and lighting for diverse driving datasets. Parallel Domain is also using the blueprint to apply similar variation to its sensor simulation.
The NVIDIA GR00T Blueprint for synthetic manipulation motion generation combines Omniverse and Cosmos Transfer to generate diverse datasets at scale, benefiting from OpenUSD-powered simulations and reducing data collection and augmentation time from days to hours.
Cosmos Predict for Intelligent World GenerationAnnounced at the CES trade show in January, Cosmos Predict WFMs generate virtual world states from multimodal inputs like text, images and video. New Cosmos Predict models will enable multi-frame generation, predicting intermediate actions or motion trajectories when given start and end input images. Purpose-built for post-training, these models can be customized using NVIDIA’s openly available physical AI dataset.
With the inference compute power of NVIDIA Grace Blackwell NVL72 systems and their large NVIDIA NVLink™ domain, developers can achieve real-time world generation.
1X is using Cosmos Predict and Cosmos Transfer to train its new humanoid robot NEO Gamma. Robot brain developer Skild AI is tapping into Cosmos Transfer to augment synthetic datasets for its robots. Plus, Nexar and Oxa are using Cosmos Predict to advance their autonomous driving systems.
Multimodal Reasoning for Physical AI Cosmos Reason is an open, fully customizable WFM with spatiotemporal awareness that uses chain-of-thought reasoning to understand video data and predict the outcomes of interactions — such as a person stepping into a crosswalk or a box falling from a shelf — in natural language.
Developers can use Cosmos Reason to improve physical AI data annotation and curation, enhance existing world foundation models or create new vision language action models. They can also post-train it to build high-level planners to tell the physical AI what it needs to do to complete a task.
Accelerating Data Curation and Post-Training for Physical AIBased on their downstream task, developers can post-train Cosmos WFMs using native PyTorch scripts or the NVIDIA NeMo™ framework on NVIDIA DGX™ Cloud.
Cosmos developers can also use NVIDIA NeMo Curator on DGX Cloud for accelerated data processing and curation. Linker Vision and Milestone Systems are using it for curating large amounts of video data to train large vision language models for visual agents built on the NVIDIA AI Blueprint for video search and summarization. Virtual Incision is exploring it to be deployed in future surgical robots, while Uber and Waabi are advancing autonomous vehicles development.
Driving Responsible AI and Content TransparencyIn line with NVIDIA’s trustworthy AI principles, NVIDIA enforces open guardrails across all Cosmos WFMs. In addition, NVIDIA is collaborating with Google DeepMind to integrate SynthID to watermark and help identify AI-generated outputs from the Cosmos WFM NVIDIA NIM™ microservice featured on build.nvidia.com.
AvailabilityCosmos WFMs are available for preview in the NVIDIA API catalog and now listed in the Vertex AI Model Garden on Google Cloud. Cosmos Predict and Cosmos Transfer are openly available on Hugging Face and GitHub. Cosmos Reason is available in early access.

Developers across the globe are building AI-RAN as a precursor to AI-native 6G wireless networks. AI-RAN is a technology that brings AI and RAN workloads together on one platform and embeds AI into radio signal processing.
To deliver enhanced spectral efficiency and lower operational complexity and costs, AI will be fully embedded into the network stack’s software and hosted over a unified accelerated infrastructure, capable of running both network and AI workloads. Also at the solution’s core will be end-to-end security and an open architecture to foster rapid innovation.
T-Mobile and NVIDIA will expand their AI-RAN Innovation Center collaboration announced last year with the goal of providing additional research-based concepts for AI-native 6G network capabilities, working alongside these new industry collaborators.
“This is an exciting next step to the AI-RAN Innovation Center efforts we began last September at our Capital Markets Day in partnership with NVIDIA,” Mike Sievert, CEO of T-Mobile. “Working with these additional industry leaders on research to natively integrate AI into the network as we begin the journey to 6G will enable the network performance, efficiency and scale to power the next generation of experiences that customers and businesses expect.”
As the founding research partner, MITRE, a not-for-profit research and development organization, will research, prototype and contribute open, AI-driven services and applications, such as for agentic network orchestration and security, dynamic spectrum sharing and 6G-integrated sensing and communications.
“MITRE is working with NVIDIA to help make AI-native 6G a reality,” said Mark Peters, president and CEO of MITRE. “By integrating AI into 6G in the beginning, we can solve a wide range of problems, from enhancing service delivery to unlocking required spectrum availability to fuel wireless growth. Through all of our collaborations with NVIDIA, we look forward to creating impact in 6G, AI, simulation, transportation and more.”
Cisco plans to take a lead position in this collaboration as the provider of mobile core and network technologies and will tap into its existing service provider reach and expertise.
“With 6G on the horizon, it’s critical for the industry to work together to build AI-native networks for the future,” said Chuck Robbins, chair and CEO of Cisco. “Cisco is at the forefront of developing secure infrastructure technology for AI, and we are proud to work with NVIDIA and the broader ecosystem to create an AI-enhanced network that improves performance, reliability and security for our customers.”
ODC, a portfolio company of Cerberus Capital Management, L.P., will deliver cutting-edge layer 2 and layer 3 software for distributed and centralized units of virtual RAN as part of the AI-native radio access stack. Tapping into decades of experience in large-scale mobile systems, ODC is pioneering next-generation AI-native 5G open RAN (ORAN), surpassing existing networks and seamlessly paving the way for 6G evolution.
“The mobile industry has always taken advantage of advances in other technology fields, and today, no technology is more central than AI,” said Shaygan Kheradpir, chairman of the advisory board of ODC. “ODC is at the forefront of developing and deploying AI-native ORAN 2.0 networks, enabling service providers to on-ramp seamlessly from 5G to 6G by taking advantage of the vast AI ecosystem to redefine the future of connectivity.”
As a leader in AI and cybersecurity to the federal government, Booz Allen will develop AI RAN algorithms and secure the AI-native 6G wireless platform. Its NextG lab will conduct functional, performance integration and security testing to ensure the resiliency and security of the platform against the most sophisticated adversaries. The company will lead field trials for advanced use cases such as autonomy and robotics.
“The future of wireless communications starts today, and it’s all about AI,” said Horacio Rozanski, chairman and CEO of Booz Allen. “Booz Allen has the technologies to make AI-native 6G networks a reality and revolutionize secure communications for an entirely new generation of intelligent platforms and applications.”
Expanded Aerial Research PortfolioThese collaborations build on NVIDIA’s AI-RAN and 6G research ecosystem, supported by advancements in the NVIDIA Aerial™ research portfolio for developing, training, simulating and deploying groundbreaking AI-native wireless innovations.
New additions to the NVIDIA Aerial Research portfolio, also announced today, include the Aerial Omniverse Digital Twin Service, the Aerial Commercial Test Bed on NVIDIA MGX™, NVIDIA Sionna™ 1.0 — building on the open-source Sionna library, which has nearly 150,000 downloads since its launch in 2022 — and the Sionna Research Kit on the NVIDIA Jetson™ accelerated computing platform. 
The NVIDIA Aerial Research portfolio serves over 2,000 members through the NVIDIA 6G Developer Program.

Non-GAAP MeasuresTo supplement NVIDIA’s condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP other income (expense), net, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, and free cash flow. For NVIDIA’s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related and other costs, other, gains from non-marketable and publicly-held equity securities, net, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, and the associated tax impact of these items where applicable. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less both purchases related to property and equipment and intangible assets and principal payments on property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user’s overall understanding of the company’s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company’s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the company’s non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

SAN JOSE, Calif., March  18, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GTC -- NVIDIA today announced a portfolio of technologies to supercharge humanoid robot development, including NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1, the world’s first open, fully customizable foundation model for generalized humanoid reasoning and skills.
The other technologies include simulation frameworks and blueprints such as the NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint for generating synthetic data, as well as Newton, an open-source physics engine — under development with Google DeepMind and Disney Research — purpose-built for developing robots.
Available now, GR00T N1 is the first of a family of fully customizable models that NVIDIA will pretrain and release to worldwide robotics developers — accelerating the transformation of industries challenged by global labor shortages estimated at more than 50 million people.
“The age of generalist robotics is here,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “With NVIDIA Isaac GR00T N1 and new data-generation and robot-learning frameworks, robotics developers everywhere will open the next frontier in the age of AI.”
GR00T N1 Advances Humanoid Developer CommunityThe GR00T N1 foundation model features a dual-system architecture, inspired by principles of human cognition. “System 1” is a fast-thinking action model, mirroring human reflexes or intuition. “System 2” is a slow-thinking model for deliberate, methodical decision-making.
Powered by a vision language model, System 2 reasons about its environment and the instructions it has received to plan actions. System 1 then translates these plans into precise, continuous robot movements. System 1 is trained on human demonstration data and a massive amount of synthetic data generated by the NVIDIA Omniverse™ platform.
GR00T N1 can easily generalize across common tasks — such as grasping, moving objects with one or both arms, and transferring items from one arm to another — or perform multistep tasks that require long context and combinations of general skills. These capabilities can be applied across use cases such as material handling, packaging and inspection.
Developers and researchers can post-train GR00T N1 with real or synthetic data for their specific humanoid robot or task.
In his GTC keynote, Huang demonstrated 1X’s humanoid robot autonomously performing domestic tidying tasks using a post-trained policy built on GR00T N1. The robot’s autonomous capabilities are the result of an AI training collaboration between 1X and NVIDIA.
“The future of humanoids is about adaptability and learning,” said Bernt Børnich, CEO of 1X Technologies. “NVIDIA’s GR00T N1 model provides a major breakthrough for robot reasoning and skills. With a minimal amount of post-training data, we were able to fully deploy on NEO Gamma — furthering our mission of creating robots that are not tools, but companions that can assist humans in meaningful, immeasurable ways.”
Among the additional leading humanoid developers worldwide with early access to GR00T N1 are Agility Robotics, Boston Dynamics, Mentee Robotics and NEURA Robotics.
NVIDIA, Google DeepMind and Disney Research Focus on PhysicsNVIDIA announced a collaboration with Google DeepMind and Disney Research to develop Newton, an open-source physics engine that lets robots learn how to handle complex tasks with greater precision.
Built on the NVIDIA Warp framework, Newton will be optimized for robot learning and compatible with simulation frameworks such as Google DeepMind’s MuJoCo and NVIDIA Isaac™ Lab. Additionally, the three companies plan to enable Newton to use Disney’s physics engine.
Google DeepMind and NVIDIA are collaborating to develop MuJoCo-Warp, which is expected to accelerate robotics machine learning workloads by more than 70x and will be available to developers through Google DeepMind’s MJX open-source library, as well as through Newton.
Disney Research will be one of the first to use Newton to advance its robotic character platform that powers next-generation entertainment robots, such as the expressive Star Wars-inspired BDX droids that joined Huang on stage during his GTC keynote.
“The BDX droids are just the beginning. We’re committed to bringing more characters to life in ways the world hasn't seen before, and this collaboration with Disney Research, NVIDIA and Google DeepMind is a key part of that vision,” said Kyle Laughlin, senior vice president at Walt Disney Imagineering Research & Development. “This collaboration will allow us to create a new generation of robotic characters that are more expressive and engaging than ever before — and connect with our guests in ways that only Disney can.”
NVIDIA and Disney Research, along with Intrinsic, announced an additional collaboration to build OpenUSD pipelines and best practices for robotics data workflows.
More Data to Advance Robotics Post-TrainingLarge, diverse, high-quality datasets are critical for robot development but costly to capture. For humanoids, real-world human demonstration data is limited by a person’s 24-hour day.
Announced today, the NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint for synthetic manipulation motion generation helps address this challenge. Built on Omniverse and NVIDIA Cosmos Transfer world foundation models, the blueprint lets developers generate exponentially large amounts of synthetic motion data for manipulation tasks from a small number of human demonstrations.
Using the first components available for the blueprint, NVIDIA generated 780,000 synthetic trajectories — the equivalent of 6,500 hours, or nine continuous months, of human demonstration data — in just 11 hours. Then, combining the synthetic data with real data, NVIDIA improved GR00T N1’s performance by 40%, compared with using only real data.
To further equip the developer community with valuable training data, NVIDIA is releasing the GR00T N1 dataset as part of a larger open-source physical AI dataset — also announced at GTC and now available on Hugging Face.
AvailabilityNVIDIA GR00T N1 training data and task evaluation scenarios are now available for download from Hugging Face and GitHub. The NVIDIA Isaac GR00T Blueprint for synthetic manipulation motion generation is also now available as an interactive demo on build.nvidia.com or to download from GitHub.
The NVIDIA DGX Spark personal AI supercomputer, also announced today at GTC, provides developers a turnkey system to expand GR00T N1’s capabilities for new robots, tasks and environments without extensive custom programming.
The Newton physics engine is expected to be available later this year.

Oops, something went wrong
Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. 
Stocks ended the week higher after a turbulent week of fresh tariff headlines driving the market action. 
But even after the S&P 500's (^GSPC) best week in over a year, the benchmark index is still down 6% since President Trump's April 2 tariff announcement. Meanwhile the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) are off roughly 5% in the same period.
In the week ahead, any incremental news on tariffs will be in focus. On Saturday news of exemptions on tariffs to China spread. Key products such as smartphones, laptop computers, hard drives and computer processors and memory chips were believed to not be subject to the tariffs, providing a potential boost to tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA).
But on Sunday, Trump disputed that report, saying there was no tariff exemption announced on Friday. He wrote on Truth Social that those products are "subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket."'
"We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations," Trump wrote.
Quarterly financial reports from a slew of American corporates will also be top of mind for investors. Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC), Citi (C), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), and Netflix (NFLX) are expected to provide updates.
On the economic data front, investors will be closely tracking an update on monthly retail sales for March due out on Wednesday.
Markets will be closed on Friday for Good Friday.
Last Wednesday, Trump announced a 90-day pause on many "reciprocal" tariffs. Markets soared with the Nasdaq Composite rising over 12% for its second-best day on record.
A day later, the White House confirmed that the total tariffs on China will now be 145% when accounting for the previous 20% duties already in place. The news came as a surprise to the market as President Trump had posted on Truth Social on Wednesday that the tariff rate charged to China would be 125%. The Nasdaq tumbled 4.3% in reaction.
Overall, the estimated effective tariff rate has moved from 22.5% on April 2 to 27% after the latest China levies, per the Yale Budget Lab.

With the US's exact landing spot on tariffs remaining a moving target, Wall Street strategists believe that recent developments show tariff uncertainty will remain a key driver of market action in the weeks ahead.
"Overall, we're kind of still where we were," Brent Schutte, Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company's chief investment officer, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday. "Certainly, some of the tension has come off the boil, but there's still a lot of uncertainty out there. And to me, uncertainty means that people are more indecisive, CEOs and consumers alike. And that is the risk going forward in the next 90 days."
Trump's tariff back-and-forth has economists arguing the risks of recession have been rising. The fear is a combination of higher prices and that overall uncertainty about policy could slow US economic growth. The recession debate comes as economic growth data has been largely weaker than expected in the start to 2025. 
A closely tracked consumer spending metric is set for release on Wednesday. The March retail sales report is expected to show sales increased 1.4% in March, up from a 0.2% increase the month prior. Excluding the volatile auto and gas, retail sales are expected to have grown 0.4%.
"Big-ticket spending in March and April could see a surge as consumers pull forward those purchases before tariffs take a significant bite," the Wells Fargo economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "After that, however, we are likely to see a weak consumer spending performance in the second half of the year."
First quarter earnings reports trickled in last week with uncertainty at the forefront of companies messaging. Delta Air Lines (DAL) pulled its full-year guidance amid what CEO Ed Bastian told Yahoo Finance is a "murky" outlook.
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the economy is facing "considerable turbulence." Meanwhile, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that "uncertainty and anxiety about the future of markets and the economy are dominating client conversations."
Strategists expect this to be a continued theme as earnings reports roll on this week.
"It's the murkiest environment you could be in outside of a pandemic," Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon told Yahoo Finance. "We're kind of entering back into that sort of environment where there's probably going to be no guidance on the aggregate level, and companies ... they can't tell us what's going to happen."
A rapid bond market sell-off has added another headwind to the bull case for stocks.
The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) soared last week, logging its largest weekly gain since November 2021. At times over the past two years, a rise in the 10-year has become a key driver of stocks' decline, particularly when the yield rises above 4.5%. At the current moment, the massive spike and increase in rate volatility appears to be the main concern among investors.
Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz told Yahoo Finance the bond market action is a "new negative" in the market narrative.
"It kind of creates this new variable that could add to the volatility during the day, when there's not headline news," Kantrowitz said while also noting regularly scheduled Treasury auctions could now be stock market moving events.
He added, "Really simply, interest rates going up at a time where there's clearly a growth scare and a recession scare and a great deal of uncertainty is just bad news period."
And with a variety of factors potentially driving the sell-off, investors don't think the chaos in the bond market is ending anytime soon.
"We're going to be in an elevated volatility environment for the time being, which is one reason why we like raising some cash in our portfolios, just to generate some flexibility," David Rogal, lead portfolio manager of the BlackRock Total Return Fund (MAHQX), told Yahoo Finance.

A lot of talk of Trump “blinking” at the moment. The US markets were up on Friday as the Trump administration softens its stance on tariffs. The S&P 500 rose 1.8% and the Nasdaq was up 2%.
The ASX/SPI Futures are indicating a small increase today of 0.2%
Investors now expect to see exemptions come into play for smartphones and computer chips. If no one can afford an iPhone how on earth are they going to be able to download Truth Social???
In the shortened week we’ll be keeping an eye on US tech, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) in particular. With the market baking in expectations of tariff exemptions, let’s all hope they actually come through. Markets are forward looking and investors will put these expectations in the share prices of these companies before Trump confirms it. If he doesn’t and digs his heels in, we’re in for another bumpy week. Tech investors will be reading into everything he says this week.
What does this mean for investors domestically? ETFs like Betashares Nasdaq 100 ETF (ASX:NDQ) and Global X FANG+ (ASX:FANG) are incredibly popular amongst our community and local investors. Holders of these ETFs should also have a keen eye on any market manipulation from Truth. This is a great time to buy (not investment advice)!
Today I’ll be heading into the office to record a podcast with Owen. He’s asked me to think about my worst investments ever, this series could run for as long as A Country Practice. I ended up categorising my mistakes into two areas, young dumb and confident dumb. The two aren’t mutually exclusive either.
I’ll tell you about my first share purchases here because Owen can’t cut me off here like he can in a pod. My first job in the investment world came doing customer service and sales for a share valuation platform called StockVal at an Australian value investing fund manager called Clime Asset Management. StockVal went on to change names to MyClime and I think it is now called Clime Direct. It was a great job, with a really fun little team.
One end of financial year I moved a lot of – and I mean a lot – of MyClime. The commission was huge for 23 year old me and made the notoriously tight CFO wince. I was really good mates with the analyst team and still are to this day, so we went for lunch and I asked them what should I invest in. Later I put in my first trades for Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX:CBA), BHP Group Limited (ASX:BHP) and Brickworks Limited (ASX:BKW).
Not exactly the most scintillating of stocks for a 20-something year old and hard to see how you could blow yourself up with them as well. I can’t remember the fad at the time but these stalwarts are definitely no medical cannabis or 3D printing. I blew myself up on something far worse. Young dumb me didn’t have an emergency fund. It is step one for self directed investors, have an emergency fund so you don’t have to interrupt your compounding. Instead of an emergency fund I did the opposite of what a sensible person should do and got a credit card to help me out….we can all guess how that ended up. It set me back years, it was awful and one of my biggest financial regrets.
One more thing I will be looking for this week is investors reactions to a potential rising market. What I don’t want to hear is people saying “I’ve missed the boat”. THERE IS NO BOAT!! Steep and sudden market pullbacks do provide a great opportunity to buy lower but do your absolute best to not get caught up in the psychological traps of market timing.
Buying the dip can be seen as a character trait of a positive long-term investor but waiting for it is market timing. Let’s all get back to following our long-term plan of investing in a diversified portfolio and dollar cost averaging over the long-term. Executing your plan consistently over decades is the real boat if there has to be a boat in this story.
Finally, here’s to hopefully a calm week. Last week was a lot. If you’d like to connect with me you can jump across to the Rask Community, Rask Invest or use the chat function in the bottom right corner.

Oops, something went wrong
Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street. 
Shares of semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) surged 18.7% on April 9, after President Trump announced a 90-day pause on the higher "reciprocal tariffs." Instead, he has authorized a "lowered reciprocal tariff of 10%" -- in line with the 10% baseline tariff set on all imports.
Investors had long been worried about the U.S. government's decision to impose import tariffs on products from various trading partners. Since this can lead to rising costs, disruptions in the supply chain, and retaliatory tariffs on American goods, many U.S. stocks saw a dramatic decline in early April 2025. The temporary pause in reciprocal tariffs seems well received by Wall Street.
Nvidia's stock is down nearly 25% from its recent high in January 2025. Although this is not a very encouraging sign, it is a solid improvement from the almost 38% drawdown from the high on April 4.
So, does valuation correction present an opportunity for investors to buy, hold, or sell Nvidia stock now? Let's find out.
Regulatory risks have emerged as a primary headwind for Nvidia. In April 2025, the U.S. government announced its decision to levy a hefty 32% tariff on imports from Taiwan and a 34% tariff from China. China responded by levying 84% retaliatory tariffs on imports from the U.S. In retaliation, the U.S. government has increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 104%.
Although semiconductors have been excluded from this round of tariffs, there are signals of a potential escalation of trade wars between the U.S. and China.
Jefferies analysts fear the possibility of additional sector-specific tariffs, including semiconductors, in subsequent tariff rounds. If true, it can lead to significant supply chain disruptions and margin pressures for Nvidia, considering that the company depends heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's fabs for chip manufacturing.
The U.S. government has long been mulling stricter controls on chip sales to China. The Chinese government's recently introduced energy-efficiency guidelines, also urge companies to use chips adhering to strict requirements in new data centers or expansions. Since Nvidia's best-selling H20 chip does not fulfil these requirements, it may hurt the company's Chinese business -- accounting for almost 13% of its revenues in fiscal 2025 (ending Jan. 26).
Nvidia is also encountering competitive pressures, though other chip manufacturers are significantly behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) race. The company is also experiencing short-term gross margin pressures due to the ongoing ramp-up of its Blackwell systems.
Despite these challenges, multiple catalysts can drive up Nvidia's share prices in the coming months.
Nvidia enjoys an unmatched technological edge in AI computing, which is evident considering its over 90% share in the AI GPU market. The company has developed a robust AI infrastructure optimized for several AI computational workloads with significant growth opportunities. These include pre-training scaling or building and upgrading foundational models with large amounts of multimodal data, post-training scaling or customizing and fine-tuning foundational models, and inferencing, including complex reasoning.
The recently launched Blackwell architecture systems have been specially architected for inference workloads (deploying and running models in a real-time environment) across various deployment environments such as on-premises, cloud, or hybrid. Blackwell is also optimized for computation-heavy reasoning inference workloads, demonstrating 25 times higher token throughput and 20 times lower cost than the Hopper 100 chips. Hence, with enterprise demand increasingly shifting from training workloads to more recurring inference workloads, Blackwell is expected to continue to be a significant growth catalyst for Nvidia.
Besides hardware, Nvidia has built a solid software ecosystem with over 5.9 million developers using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and other software platforms. The company has also recently introduced software offerings such as Nvidia AI Enterprise and Nvidia Inference Microservices to enable enterprises to deploy AI solutions effectively. This software advantage has led to high switching costs, which has resulted in a sticky customer base.
Finally, the rapid adoption of AI agents and robotics is also proving to be a significant growth avenue for Nvidia. Blackwell chips are well poised to benefit from the evolving agentic AI opportunity, as it has the computational power and low latency required for building systems capable of making complex decisions and planning.
Nvidia is trading at 24.45 times forward earnings, far lower than its five-year average of 71.54x. Hence, it is evident that most of the risks are already priced at the company's share price.
But Nvidia also has a history of rebounding significantly after deep falls. Some of the recent events can better highlight this trend.
This was seen in 2018, when the stock crashed over 53% from its peak in early October 2018 to its low in late December 2018. The decline was mainly due to the crypto market crash amid the global tech sell-off, resulting in excess inventory buildup for Nvidia. However, the stock recovered by over 65% in 2019, after inventory levels normalized and sales in gaming and data center segments started showing strong momentum.
Nvidia stock also crashed by 30% from its recent peak in February 2020 to its low in March 2020 due to marketwide uncertainty and supply chain disruptions in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, by March 2021, the stock had soared over 100%, driven mainly by increased demand for gaming and data center services during the pandemic.
Finally, Nvidia stock crashed almost 66% from November 2021 to mid-October 2022, due to concerns about rising interest rates and supply chain disruptions. But then, the stock had recovered over 200% by October 2023, fueled by explosive demand in AI and data center markets and the company's focus on product innovation.
Hence, historically, Nvidia has returned even stronger within 12 months after a significant stock decline. Therefore, it makes sense for retail investors to acquire at least a small stake in this stock to benefit from its future growth prospects.
