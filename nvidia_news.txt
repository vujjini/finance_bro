The major U.S. stock indexes inched higher on Friday, April 11, 2025, as traders cautiously navigated the final trading session of what has been one of the most volatile weeks in recent market history. The S&P 500 added 0.2%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hovered near the flatline, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4%.
This modest recovery comes after Thursday’s steep selloff when the Dow tumbled over 1,000 points (2.5%), the S&P 500 fell 3.46%, and the Nasdaq plunged 4.31%. Despite Friday’s gains, the major indexes remain well below their levels before President Trump’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcements on April 2.
Weekly Performance:– Dow Jones: +3.3% for the week– S&P 500: +3.8% for the week– Nasdaq Composite: +5.1% for the week
The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s “fear gauge,” has retreated from its midweek spike above 50 but remains elevated near 44, reflecting continued uncertainty in the markets.
Market volatility has been primarily driven by the rapidly evolving trade situation. After Wednesday’s historic rally following Trump’s announcement of a 90-day pause on many “reciprocal” tariffs, markets tumbled Thursday when the White House clarified that goods from China would still face a staggering 145% tariff rate.
China retaliated on Friday by raising its levies on U.S. products to 125% from 84%, with the Chinese finance ministry stating, “Even if the U.S. continues to impose higher tariffs, it will no longer make economic sense and will become a joke in the history of world economy.”
Meanwhile, the European Union has paused its retaliatory tariffs and announced its trade representative will fly to Washington on Sunday to “try and sign deals” during the 90-day reprieve period.
The first-quarter earnings season officially began with major banks reporting results that offered insights into the economic impact of recent trade tensions:
– JPMorgan Chase (JPM) shares rose over 2% after reporting better-than-expected Q1 earnings of $5.07 per share on revenue of $46.01 billion, driven by record equities trading amid market volatility. CEO Jamie Dimon maintained a cautious tone, noting that “clients have become more cautious amid an increase in market volatility driven by geopolitical and trade-related tensions.”
– Wells Fargo (WFC) shares rose about 1% in early trading despite reporting a 6% year-over-year decline in net interest income to $11.50 billion. CEO Charlie Scharf highlighted economic uncertainty, stating, “We support the administration’s willingness to look at barriers to fair trade for the United States, though there are certainly risks associated with such significant actions.”
– Morgan Stanley (MS) gained more than 1% after reporting Q1 net revenue of $17.7 billion, exceeding analyst expectations of $16.56 billion.
The “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks showed mixed performance on Friday, with most posting modest gains that helped support the broader market:
– Nvidia (NVDA) and Alphabet (GOOGL) led the group with gains exceeding 2%– Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) each rose more than 1%– Amazon (AMZN) edged up 0.24%
However, U.S. chip manufacturers faced significant pressure after the China Semiconductor Association announced that chip tariffs will be based on where they are manufactured rather than shipped from. Texas Instruments (TXN) plunged more than 9%, while Microchip Technology (MCHP) and Intel (INTC) dropped more than 7%.
Investors should keep an eye on these key events in the coming weeks:
1. European Central Bank Meeting (April 17): Markets are pricing in a 95% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut.
2. Tech Earnings: Major tech companies reporting in the next two weeks include:   – Netflix (NFLX): April 17   – Tesla (TSLA): April 22   – Alphabet (GOOGL): April 25   – Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META): April 30
3. Economic Data: Upcoming releases will be closely watched for signs of inflation driven by tariffs and potential economic slowdown.
Despite Friday’s modest gains, market sentiment remains cautious as investors assess the economic impact of escalating trade tensions. JPMorgan economists have reduced their estimate of a U.S. and global recession this year to 50%, down from 60% earlier this month.
Minneapolis Fed President Kashkari made hawkish comments today, reiterating that “the potential inflationary impact of tariffs makes the Fed less likely to lower interest rates, even in the face of a weakening economy.”
As earnings season accelerates in the coming weeks, with over 55% of S&P 500 companies reporting between April 21 and May 2, investors will be closely monitoring corporate guidance for insights into how businesses are navigating the uncertain trade environment.
The dollar index weakened 1% on Friday, putting it on track to end the week down by 3%, while safe-haven assets like gold reached new all-time highs, reflecting ongoing concerns about economic stability.
As we move forward, market participants will be watching closely for any developments in trade negotiations and signs of economic impact from the tariff policies that have dominated market sentiment throughout this turbulent week.

Over the week, the Trump admin suffered a heavy credibility blow. Only shortly after introducing the term “panican”, describing people stressing over market instability as “weak and stupid”, President Trump himself became a panican. Namely, after the 10-year Treasury yield went over 4.5%, he abruptly backflipped from global reciprocal tariffs.
Reminder, the rising Treasury yield is the exact opposite of what both President Trump and Treasury Secretary Bessent want.
“He and I are focused on the 10-year Treasury and what is the yield of that.”
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Fox Business
The sudden tariff reversal was on the same day they were set to take effect. On Wednesday, the new policy is a 90-day suspension of tariffs for most nations, excluding the baseline 10% rate. However, the trade war against China seems to be escalating, with tariffs increased to 125%, (145% if counting the previous 20%) to which China retaliated with equal measure of 125% on US imports.
While this is concerning, investors should remind themselves there has been a bipartisan consensus among the U.S. ruling class, spanning many decades, to transform China into the world’s manufacturing hub.
But in the present, China-reliant companies are likely to suffer. And at times like this suppressed valuation, one should consider their exposure, based on their long-term fundamentals.
In 2024, the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) rival made most of its sales in the US at 34.45%, with China just behind at 24.70%. Moreover, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) has experienced far greater growth in Asia year-over-year.
Year-to-date, AMD stock is down 23%, currently priced at $92 per share. However, a regular customer of AMD products would think otherwise. The company’s Ryzen series of CPUs continues to trample competition, with the latest X3D series becoming top performers for both gamers and content creators.
Owing to 3D V-Cache innovation, AMD’s Ryzen CPUs firmly restored performance leadership over Intel while also being energy efficient. On the GPU front, although AMD’s RDNA 4 architecture failed to outperform Nvidia high-end offering, Nvidia greatly fumbled the launch of its RTX 50 series GPUs.
At the same time, AMD offered cost-effective GPUs, lacking QC issues that seem to plague the RTX 50 launch. In short, AMD is likely to significantly increase both CPU and GPU market shares in the following upgrade cycles, having already achieved a record 45% GPU market share in Japan.
And the way trends are, tariffs may not even be on anyone’s radar in a few months. In the meantime, AMD has proven time and time again to deliver highly competitive products just when they are needed.
According to WSJ, the average AMD price target right now is $145.70 against the present price of $92 per share. This price aligns with the estimated bottom target of $90, which makes AMD stock an excellent opportunity at this point in time.
We covered Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) in September 2024, just before its 10-for-1 forward stock split. At that time, LRCX was considered undervalued due to the company’s critical contribution in supplying the world’s chipmakers with equipment while Nvidia captured the public spotlight (as a chip designer).
Lam’s products, in particular selective etch systems Argos, Prevos and Selis, are widely used by all semiconductor players, from Samsung (KS:005930) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) to TSMC and Intel. Given the complexity and delicacy of Lam’s products, the company has a wide moat.
And that moat is constantly expanding as chipmakers like Intel expand to service national security needs. While it is true that 31% of Lam Research revenue comes from China vs just 9% from the US, as of end 2024, this represents a diversified risk. After all, China-linked sales are owed to multinationals, not purely domesting Chinese firms.
At the end of the line, Lam’s etching dominance makes it irreplaceable for both the US and friend-shoring allies like Taiwan, Japan and South Korea. While geopolitical tensions may reshape where chips are made, Lam’s moat lies in how they’re made — a process its tools uniquely enable, regardless of borders.
Year-to-date, LRCX stock is only down 10%. Per WSJ forecasting data, the average LRCX price target is $96.31 per share. Against the present price of $65 per share, the bottom estimate of $75 is significantly higher.
The premium US electric vehicle maker has a 35% YTD stock slump. As Elon Musk took the mantle of politics, he transferred that vulnerability to the company. This even resulted in street-level action against Tesla car owners, putting in doubt Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s very brand. Additionally, heavily controlled media apparatus in the EU has already resulted in a 40% sales drop year-over-year.
Moreover, ~21% of Tesla’s revenue comes from China. When it comes to tariff, it is notable that Elon Musk is not quite on the same page as President Trump, having said this during the Biden admin:
“Tesla competes quite well in the market in China with no tariffs and no deferential support. In general, I’m in favor of no tariffs,”
Although Tesla is better positioned than other EV makers, the company still has substantial outsourcing for auto components. Accordingly, when the tariffs were first announced, Musk said on X that the “tariff impact on Tesla is still significant.”
But with all these headwinds, why would TSLA exposure be optimal now? Ahead of Q1 2025 earnings on April 22nd, Tesla still has substantial capacity to pivot, innovate with a robust FSD, and dominate the long-term EV transition with robotaxis.
This early on in the Trump admin, China risks are likely overstated. The same applies to branding issues as the astroturfed backlash loses its vigor, and as the Trump admin treats assailants as “domestic terrorism”.
At present $245, TSLA stock reverted to early November 2024 level, just after the Robotaxi Day event. With progress on FSD and cheap Model 2, this may end up being a rare discount opportunity.

As the U.S. braces for the onset of the first-quarter earnings season, the S&P 500 faces its next pivotal moment against the backdrop of a looming trade war and economic uncertainty.
The latest forecasts suggest that S&P 500 earnings will have grown 7.0% year-on-year for the quarter ending March, as per FactSet data.

However, the optimism of these figures is tempered by the cloud of tariffs and their potential impact on corporate outlooks. Notably, companies with significant international exposure may face greater challenges, as tariffs can directly affect their supply chains and profit margins.
The earnings season kicks off with major financial institutions set to release their reports. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) are scheduled to announce their Q1 earnings on April 11.
The banking sector, often among the first to feel the tremors of economic shifts, will provide an early indicator of how companies are navigating the current challenges. Investors will be listening closely, knowing that any hint of pessimism could ripple across the broader market.
Beyond the banking sector, investors are keenly observing developments across various industries to gauge the impact of tariffs and trade negotiations on corporate performance and growth projections.
Next week sees high-profile names like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), United Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL), UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM), and ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) report earnings.
Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Boeing (NYSE:BA), AT&T (NYSE:T), Verizon (NYSE:VZ), GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), are then due the following week.
The earnings season gathers momentum in the last week of April when the mega-cap tech companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are all scheduled to release their quarterly updates.
From technology to manufacturing, each sector has its unique vulnerabilities to trade disruptions, and the upcoming earnings season will be a telling indicator of how these companies are adapting and forecasting future demand.
Beyond the reported earnings figures, investors are particularly interested in the forward guidance provided by companies for insights into how tariffs and economic uncertainties are impacting future outlooks. A dour forecast from a bellwether firm could amplify fears that the economy is losing steam.
Tariffs were mentioned over 800 times in investor events and calls during Q4 - the highest number in 15 years and double the mentions during Trump's 2018-2019 trade war. Management commentary on future earnings prospects, capital expenditures, and strategies to mitigate tariff impacts will be crucial in assessing the resilience of businesses.
Companies that demonstrate adaptability and provide clear strategies for navigating the current trade environment may instill greater confidence among investors.
Wall Street is heading into the Q1 reporting season on a wobbly note as the imposition of tariffs has introduced significant volatility into the markets, leading to concerns about a potential recession.

From a technical standpoint, the S&P 500 remains at a critical level below its 200-day moving average. After dropping below this key indicator in early March and hitting a low of 4,835 on April 7, the index staged a rally. However, analysts caution this may only be a technical rebound from oversold conditions.
Given the current economic backdrop, I used the InvestingPro Stock Screener to search for companies that are forecast to deliver growth of more than 25% in both earnings per share and revenue. In total, just 29 stocks showed up.

Some of the notable names to make the cut include Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), Boeing, Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Sea, Capital One Financial (NYSE:COF), Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC), Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) Technology, Cloudflare (NYSE:NET), AngloGold Ashanti, DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG), and Coterra Energy (NYSE:CTRA).
As companies begin reporting, investors will be scrutinizing not just the numbers but forward guidance and management commentary on tariff impacts.
With the S&P 500 down 10.5% year-to-date and markets briefly entering bear market territory, this earnings season could determine whether we're experiencing a temporary pullback or the beginning of a more significant downturn.
One thing is for certain –the market's extreme sensitivity to trade policy developments suggests volatility will remain elevated in the coming weeks.

Nancy Pelosi has an estimated net worth of £187.35 million ($245.16 million), according to alternative data platform Quiver Quantitative. It is believed that she accumulated most of her wealth through stock investments. Public disclosure reports revealed that her husband, Paul Pelosi, executes trades on her behalf, which have returned triple-digit returns over the past decade. While Paul's near-perfect timing of the markets drove speculations of insider trading, Pelosi's 2025 trades worth £1.49 million ($1.95 million) might not be working out in the ongoing market turmoil.
According to the latest public disclosure report, Pelosi purchased call options on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST), and Tempus AI (NASDAQ:TEM) in January. Most of these investments are now trading in red, excluding Tempus AI.
On 14th January, Pelosi purchased 50 call options contracts on Alphabet with a strike price of £114 ($150) and an expiry of 16th January 2026, worth between £191,047 ($250,001) and £382,092 ($500,000). As per Optionchart.io data, the last contract price was £17.12 ($22.4) on 10th April compared with £39.89 ($53.2) on 14th January, when Pelosi executed the transaction, implying potential unrealised losses of 57% on the trade.
On the same day, Pelosi added 50 Amazon call options with a £114.83 ($150) strike price and an expiry date of 16th January 2026, worth between $250,001 and $500,000. The contract price has since declined to £41.53 ($54.35) on 10th April from £61.17 ($80.04) on 14th January, implying losses of over 32%.
Pelosi's next pick was 50 Nvidia options with a £61.13 ($80) strike price and an expiry date of 16th January 2026. This trade is also worth between $250,001 and $500,000, as per the disclosure report. The contract price closed at £46.89 ($61.36) on 14th January but fell to £32.33 ($42.3) on 10th April, implying a drop of 31%.
Pelosi's biggest derivatives purchase in 2025 is Vistra Corp., worth between £382,093 ($500,001) and £764,185 ($1 million). She purchased 50 call options of the company on 14th January with a strike price of £38.21 ($50) and a 16th January 2026 expiry. According to 15th January data, the contract price closed at £93.1 ($121.83) compared with £48.91 ($64) on 10th April, implying a 47% drop.
Pelosi's investment in Tempus AI is about the only trade holding up in green. She purchased 50 call options on the AI healthcare company with a £15.28 ($20) strike price and an expiry date of 16th January 2026. The contract price was £12.23 ($16) on the date of trade execution and more than quadrupled in mid-February before declining to £19.49 ($25.5) on 10th April. Pelosi's investment is potentially up 37% on this trade.
Her portfolio beat top hedge funds in 2024, with 54% annual gains. However, her investments could be down tens of millions of dollars in 2025.
Although Pelosi's investment portfolio has jumped by over 600% since May 2014, US President Donald Trump's tariff plans and an escalating trade war with China have triggered a market upheaval that is refusing to settle down despite a 90-day pause in reciprocal tariffs on other countries. Quiver Quantitative co-founder Chris Kardatzke said in March that Pelosi's net worth had fallen by £11.08 million ($14.5 million) since the end of January.
