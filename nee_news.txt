=== ARTICLE FROM: https://www.investing.com/analysis/2-defensive-sectors-to-protect-your-portfolio-during-a-recession-200659222 ===
As recession fears rise and the fear index plummets toward levels last seen during the March 2020 pandemic panic, U.S. and global equities are taking a significant hit. Investors are beginning to feel the pressure as trade tensions escalate, with China and the European Union, key U.S. trading partners, doubling down on retaliatory tariffs. With no trade resolution in sight, the market continues to spiral lower.
Technology stocks have been hit especially hard as investors aggressively rotate out of risk assets. Ahead of Monday’s open, futures are signaling further losses. The Technology Sector SPDR ETF (NYSE:XLK) is now down 21.5% year-to-date and 25% off its 52-week high as of Friday’s close. Meanwhile, as of Friday’s close, the S&P 500 has fallen nearly 18% from its recent peak.
With this level of volatility and uncertainty, many investors might wonder: Which sectors typically outperform during recessions and times of fear? While no corner of the market is entirely immune to sell-offs, history shows that two sectors, Consumer Staples and Utilities, tend to provide relative safety and stability during downturns.
The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF is down just over 7% from its 52-week high as of Friday’s close, much less than the broader market. That relative strength reflects the sector’s defensive nature. It also offers a 2.6% dividend yield, adding an income cushion during volatile periods.
Consumer staples include everyday essentials like toothpaste, household cleaning products, food, and beverages. No matter how bad the economy gets, people still need to buy these goods. That steady demand benefits companies like Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), giving the sector a reliable edge over more cyclical industries like tech or discretionary retail.
Though the sector hasn’t been immune to the sell-off, its milder decline signals defensive positioning. That said, investors should proceed with caution. On Friday, XLP closed below its rising 200-day moving average and looks set to open lower on Monday. Watching top holdings such as Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Walmart, and Coca-Cola for signs of stabilization and relative strength could help investors identify when the sector begins to attract renewed interest as a haven.
The Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF has also shown notable resilience. Year-to-date, it is down just 1.5% and about 11% from its 52-week high, considerably less than the S&P 500’s drawdown. Like consumer staples, utilities benefit from their essential nature and reliable revenue streams, which help them weather economic storms better than most sectors.
The utilities sector includes companies that provide critical services like electricity, natural gas, water, and sewage systems. These services are needed regardless of economic conditions, making the sector a historically strong performer during downturns. XLU also offers an attractive 3.06% dividend yield, which can appeal to income-focused investors in turbulent markets.
However, the sector hasn’t escaped the broader market pain. On Friday, XLU fell more than 5%, and based on futures, it looks set for another tough session on Monday. Many of its top holdings, including Southern Company (NYSE:SO), Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK), and NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), are trading near or below their 200-day SMAs. Investors may want to monitor these names closely to see if they begin to outperform relative to the market, signaling a shift toward defensiveness.
Consumer Staples and Utilities have historically been two go-to sectors, among others, for investors seeking stability during market turbulence and recessionary periods. While the current sell-off is intense and the geopolitical backdrop remains uncertain, these two sectors might offer a measure of safety, and possibly even opportunity, for long-term investors looking to weather the storm.
As always, watching for signs of relative strength and stabilization in top holdings can help confirm whether capital is rotating into these traditionally defensive sectors.

A Texas experiment to fund new natural gas-burning power plants with $5 billion in public loans is faltering as several of the proposed facilities drop out, threatening the state’s efforts to meet growing electricity demand.
Together, the projects that have left the program could have generated 4.6 gigawatts of electricity — enough for about a million Texas homes. Developers say that even with low-interest loans from the state, their projects no longer pencil out due to cost uncertainties and problems procuring equipment. Some have also faulted the program’s strict deadlines and terms.
The fund was touted by lawmakers as a way to jumpstart gas-plant development at a time when cheap solar and wind power have cut into the state’s wholesale electricity prices, reducing the potential profits for new plants.
“When you have zero or negative prices for power, it’s really hard to build,” said Jim Burke, chief executive officer of Vistra Corp., at a conference held by the Electric Power Supply Association on Wednesday in Washington, DC. Two Vistra projects are under consideration for Texas loans.
It’s an unexpected setback for the Texas Energy Fund, a closely watched effort to meet fast-rising power demand with natural gas. State lawmakers established the fund with voter backing in 2023, as a growing population and economy pushed electricity demands to new records and strained supplies. A wave of planned data centers — some of them needing as much power as a small city — promised even faster growth to come. Although Texas prides itself on an “all of the above” approach to energy, not officially favoring one source over another, the fund’s backers said gas was needed to generate large amounts of power around the clock, without the variability of solar and wind.
The effort initially drew 72 project applications, far more than could have been funded. From that pool, regulators with the Public Utility Commission of Texas picked 17 projects — capable of generating 9.8 gigawatts total — to move forward into due diligence. Days later, however, they rejected one of the biggest — a 1.3-gigawatt project from Aegle Power — because the company named utility giant NextEra Energy Inc. as a sponsor without NextEra’s knowledge or consent, according to a filing.
The program suffered a dual blow last week when Constellation Energy Corp., the largest US independent power producer based on market value, and WattBridge Energy, a leading private developer of gas generation in Texas, withdrew almost 2 gigawatts of projects from consideration. Constellation said its 300-megawatt plant southwest of Dallas was facing too much cost uncertainty around a pending air permit. WattBridge said the loan program itself was adding risks and costs.
The PUC has replaced some of the projects only to see more pull out. There are now 16 proposals being actively reviewed for nearly $4.5 billion in loans, PUC spokeswoman Ellie Breed said in an email. Of the original pool of project applications, 12% have been withdrawn or rejected. Of those invited into due diligence, nearly a third have fallen out.
Citigroup Inc. analysts, in a research note this week, said the fund was “falling apart” and questioned whether the state would add much gas generation after all. “We expect several more gas power developers to remove themselves from the TEF,” analysts Ryan Levine and Amber Zhao wrote.
Texas is a microcosm of a debate raging across the country over how best to meet rising demand for electricity, driven by the data center boom and the electrification of cars and factories. Data center developers need access to more electricity than current infrastructure can easily provide, so they’re looking for locations where new supplies can be quickly brought online. “Speed to market is the overriding factor,” said Aaron Tinjum, vice president of energy from the Data Center Coalition trade group, at the Electric Power Supply Association conference.
The Texas Energy Fund was controversial from the start. Critics questioned its focus on natural gas after many of the state’s existing gas plants failed during a severe 2021 winter storm, triggering widespread blackouts. Still, Texas lawmakers are expected to double the fund’s size during their current session.
Incentives won’t necessarily speed up projects. So few gas-fired plants were built in the US in recent years that turbine manufacturers decreased their production capacity, said Andrew Waranch, chief executive officer of battery developer Spearmint Energy. Both Siemens Energy AG and GE Vernova Inc. have warned of multi-year wait times for turbines. “It’s going to take a very long time for the supply chain to catch up,” Waranch said.
