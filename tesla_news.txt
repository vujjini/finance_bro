Kimbal Musk, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) board member and brother of CEO Elon Musk, has gone public with sharp criticism of President Donald Trump’s trade policies, calling tariffs a “structural, permanent tax on the American consumer” and accusing Trump of celebrating economic self-sabotage.
“Mmm.. Celebrating causing China’s stock market to go down, by causing our own stock market to go down? Maybe this is why Trump brought back the R word.” Kimbal posted on X, in response to a message from Trump touting the impact of U.S. tariffs.

As the backlash against Elon Musk intensifies, a record number of Tesla, Inc. TSLA owners are rushing to offload their vehicles, flooding the used market and driving prices down.
What Happened: The used car market saw a record surge in Tesla listings in March, with over 13,000 used Teslas posted for sale on Autotrader, according to Cox Automotive, reported Business Insider.
That marks a 67% year-over-year increase and comes amid nationwide protests dubbed the “Tesla Takedown,” which targeted Musk's growing political affiliations — including his role as head of DOGE and close ties to the Donald Trump administration.

A Cox Automotive spokesperson told the publication that the spike in listings is being driven by two main factors: Tesla's massive growth between 2021 and 2023, which naturally feeds into the used market now, and Musk's increasingly polarizing public image.
"We cannot ignore the influence of Elon Musk's new high-profile job as DOGE boss and presidential confidant. That is certainly influencing some owners and buyers," the spokesperson said.
Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, said that Musk's political and public persona is creating “significant challenges” for Tesla, compounding issues like rising competition and an aging vehicle lineup.
Why It Matters: The surge in used Tesla inventory is weighing on prices. According to CarGurus, the average used Tesla now sells for about $10,000 less than other electric vehicles, the report noted.
Tesla is trying to regain momentum with two major launches this year: a more affordable EV model expected in the first half and a robotaxi service slated to debut in Austin, Texas, in June.
According to a Cox Automotive report, the U.S. EV market saw a 10.6% year-over-year growth in the first quarter of 2025, although Tesla experienced a decline.
Despite this, Tesla remains a dominant force in the domestic EV market. Despite an 8.6% drop in sales year over year, Tesla still leads the segment with a commanding 43.5% market share.
Tesla’s expansion into new markets, such as Saudi Arabia, highlights its global ambitions despite challenges in Europe. However, a new consumer survey in March revealed that Musk is making Americans less inclined to purchase a new Tesla.
According to Benzinga's Proprietary Edge Rankings, Tesla holds a momentum rating of 90.20% and a growth rating of 67.67%. For more stock insights and growth opportunities, subscribe to Benzinga Edge.
