Bank holidays today: All public and private banks across India, including the State Bank of India (SBI), are closed today, on April 10, for Mahavir Jayanti, April 12 for second Saturday, and April 13 for Sunday weekly off holiday. Take a look at the details and bank holiday schedule for April 2025 here.
Notably, the second and fourth Saturdays and every Sunday in each month are holidays for all banks. Keep an eye out for the extended weekends due to this as April 14 and 15 are also bank holidays in some states for Ambedkar Jayanti and state-specific festivals such as Bengali New Year, Bohag Bihu, and Himachal Day, respectively.
In addition to the common national and gazetted holidays, banks in India could have local holidays and festivals off, as required. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) releases its annual, official bank holiday list in January. Please ask your nearest local bank branch for their confirmed holiday schedule for 2025.
We take a look at all the upcoming bank holiday dates this month:
Yes, you can use ATMs, mobile banking, online banking, and bank apps for daily transactions even during bank holidays, unless a bank sends specific notification regarding maintenance timings or technical issues. However, the Negotiable Instruments Act deals with the issuance of cheques and promissory notes and transactions involving these instruments will not be available during the holidays.
Thus, it is advisable to check the confirmed holiday schedule from your own local bank branch and make arrangements to deal with any extended closures or emergencies on particular dates.

Wednesday's jaw-dropping stock-market rally on President Donald Trump's surprising tariff reversal is one for the history books.
The S&P 500 skyrocketed 9.52% in a kneejerk reaction to Trump's announcement to put a 90-day pause on some of the lofty 'reciprocal' tariffs. The one-day gain ranks as the third biggest since World War II for the main stock market benchmark, according to FactSet.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 2,962.86 points, or 7.87% and posted its biggest advance since March 2020. 
The Nasdaq Composite jumped 12.16%, notching its largest one-day jump since January 2001 and second-best day ever. 
"This is the pivotal moment we've been waiting for," said Gina Bolvin, president of Bolvin Wealth Management Group. "The immediate market reaction has been overwhelmingly positive, as investors interpret this as a step toward much-needed clarity."
The market was a coiled spring after a brutal four-day stretch that briefly pushed the S&P 500 into bear-market territory. Over the course of the previous four trading sessions, the S&P 500 suffered a 12% loss, a decline not seen since the pandemic. The Dow lost more than 4,500 points during the four-day stretch, while the Nasdaq was down more than 13%.
While stocks managed to recoup much of the losses, investors are not completely out of the woods as Trump vows to reorient global trade. The president said more than 75 countries contacted U.S. officials to negotiate after he unveiled his new tariffs last week.
"It's still too early to signal an all clear," said Dave Sekera, Morningstar's chief U.S. market strategist. "Trade negotiations have yet to start and once they do, there will be positive and negative headlines as each party positions itself to extract the maximum amount of concessions possible."

Cancers are the ultimate nurturers of the zodiac. With their deep emotional intelligence and ability to sense what others are feeling, they make you feel truly seen and heard. They'll hug you, cry with you, and then whip up a plan to help you heal — all before you finish venting.

Virgos may not always be the warm-and-fuzzy type, but when you need actionable advice or someone to help sort out the chaos in your life, they're your go-to. They analyse your problems with laser focus and offer practical, well-thought-out solutions — like your own personal life coach.

Pisces are gentle, intuitive, and deeply compassionate. They’ll pick up on your moods even before you say a word. Talking to them feels like emotional therapy — they’re great at validating your feelings and reminding you that it’s okay to be vulnerable.

Libras are natural diplomats. They hate conflict but love helping others find balance. They're excellent at seeing both sides of a situation and helping you navigate emotional gray areas. Expect soothing vibes, thoughtful advice, and maybe a little humor to lighten the mood.

Taurus friends bring calm and stability during emotional storms. They're dependable, grounded, and great at making you feel secure. Whether it’s letting you crash at their place or just offering a steady presence, they help you breathe when life feels overwhelming.

Scorpios go deep — emotionally, spiritually, and psychologically. They can hold space for the dark, uncomfortable truths most others avoid. If you're going through something heavy, they won’t flinch. Instead, they’ll help you face it head-on and transform pain into power.

Aquarians might seem aloof at first, but they give brilliant, unbiased advice. They're big-picture thinkers who help you zoom out of your emotional drama and look at life with a fresh perspective. Expect unorthodox insights, big ideas, and some much-needed clarity.
