Oops, something went wrong
The sudden and sharp stock market sell-off following the Trump administration's tariff announcements on April 2 is hitting the world's largest technology companies. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta Platforms (Facebook), Nvidia, and Tesla -- a group known as the "Magnificent Seven" stocks -- have plunged from their highs.
Of these seven tech giants, Apple has suffered the sharpest decline thus far in response to the Trump tariffs.
Is the stock's decline warranted? How might tariffs impact Apple and its beloved iOS products? Most importantly, should investors buy the dip or wait this out?
Here's what you need to know.
The Trump administration's announced tariff plan, barring changes, will have far-reaching effects on the world's economy and manufacturing landscape. President Donald Trump's plan applies a 10% unilateral tariff on U.S. imports, which began on April 5. Additionally, the government will, starting April 9, apply incremental "reciprocal tariffs" on imports from countries the administration deems to have mistreated the United States in trade.
America imports far more than it exports, so these plans signal a massive change to the country's existing trade policies and could increase prices for U.S. consumers.
If the announced reciprocal rates go into effect, they'll dramatically affect Apple, whose supply chain is almost entirely outside the United States; its manufacturing occurs in China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam. Here are the announced reciprocal tariff rates for those countries:
China: 34%
India: 26%
Japan: 24%
South Korea: 25%
Taiwan: 32%
Vietnam: 46%
Beyond that, Apple sources most of its hardware components from foreign countries as well. Due to tariffs, an iPhone could cost as much as 43% more. Apple will either have to eat some or all of those costs, or pass them on to U.S. consumers, likely hurting sales.
The tariffs are a clear downward catalyst for Apple stock, but they're not the only one. There is a strong argument that Apple has bungled its first crack at artificial intelligence (AI) thus far. It integrated AI features into Siri and iOS late last year, dubbing them Apple Intelligence. However, that hasn't ignited iPhone sales as hoped, and the lukewarm reception led the company to shuffle its internal AI leadership.
The situation doesn't exactly inspire confidence. Plus, Apple stock entered the year trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of more than 40, although analysts had been steadily lowering their estimates of long-term earnings growth since early 2022:
Multibillionaire Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, spent most of the past year selling down his company's massive stake in Apple. It remains Berkshire's largest position, but Buffett, famous for his eye for valuations, clearly saw trouble that long preceded the recent tariff shock.
Tariffs were the match that ignited Apple's decline, but the kindling was dry, and a decline was probably imminent.
Apple is widely regarded as one of the world's most preeminent companies and is a fine addition to any long-term portfolio. Unfortunately, it's probably way too soon to buy shares right now. The stock still trades at 30 times earnings, and the company's future growth could implode if tariffs squeeze profits or sink demand for new iPhones.
I think Apple will figure something out here. Just weeks ago, it announced a plan to invest $500 billion in the United States, which may help it negotiate some relief from the announced tariff rates.
Still, Apple is arguably too expensive for its lackluster growth, and that's before factoring in any tariff impacts. You may want to reevaluate once the tariff dust settles and the stock trades at a P/E closer to 20, which would more appropriately reflect its growth. Until then, Apple is still not ready to bite into.

WASHINGTON, DC - APRIL 02: U.S. President Donald Trump holds up a chart while speaking during a ... More “Make America Wealthy Again” trade announcement event in the Rose Garden at the White House on April 2, 2025 in Washington, DC. Touting the event as “Liberation Day”, Trump is expected to announce additional tariffs targeting goods imported to the U.S. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)
President Donald Trump's declaration of "Liberation Day," announced sweeping tariffs impacting nearly all sectors of the U.S. economy. Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent acknowledged that they intended to dampen the stock market in order to bring down interest rates to service the trillions of dollars in US debt. His aim, so far, backfired. Instead of accolades, tensions escalated with international allies and increased the likelihood of a global trade war and recession.
These tariffs triggered panic selling both in the US and global stock markets. The result is one of the largest stock market declines since the 2020 COVID-19-induced stock market crash. Additionally, the economic downturn has created widespread uncertainty, with significant implications for trade, investments, and employment.
Trump’s tariff policies have plunged the U.S. and international economies into uncharted territory. What began as a high-stakes gamble to rebalance trade has morphed into a full-blown crisis. There are and will be profound implications for the job market, economic growth, and global trade.
Trump’s tariff gamble aimed to reshape global trade in America’s favor. Instead, he may have unraveled the economy. Jobs are in jeopardy, prices could rise, and there is concern about a recession. Negotiated relief could still happen, but it doesn’t look like Trump will stop this train. For now, American workers need to contend with a turbulent road ahead.
Job seekers and workers will face challenges until there is a resolution of the tariff situation. Corporations want clarity. With uncertainty, it’s hard for business leaders to make long term decisions. Job seekers, employees, and executives alike are held captive by events outside of their control. Companies need to figure out how supply chain disruptions, falling stock prices, and plunging consumer demand could impact their businesses. For example, Stellantis decided to halt production at plants in Mexico and Canada, laying off 900 U.S. workers at powertrain and stamping facilities, according to CNN.
Tariffs, creating higher prices, reduce a families’ disposable income and consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of the U.S. GDP. Deutsche Bank economists highlight a significant rise in recession risk due to reduced demand for foreign goods and increased production costs for U.S. businesses. Mark Zandi, Chief Economist at Moody’s Analytics, estimates that a U.S. recession triggered by tariffs could lead to a 2% GDP reduction and unemployment rising to 7.5%. Slower GDP growth, a projected hit of 0.4-1%, raises concerns about stagflation, a phenomenon last seen in the 1970s.
The combination of falling stock prices, job losses, and reduced consumer spending shows some signs of recession risks. J.P. Morgan estimates a 60% probability of recession in 2025, up from 40% before tariffs were imposed. EY’s Gregory Daco forecasts a GDP decline of 1.5-2.1% over 2025-2026. However, on the positive side, the Federal Reserve may respond with up to four rate cuts this year starting in June.
LinkedIn News reported that BLS layoffs in March 2025 reached 275,240, marking the third-highest monthly total ever recorded, surpassed only by April and May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), spearheaded by Elon Musk under President Donald Trump's administration, accounted for the vast majority of these cuts, with 216,215 layoffs in the federal workforce.
Even if tariffs are lifted, Trump’s promise of repatriated jobs remains questionable. Building new factories takes years, and supply chain chaos is delaying any staffing rebound. The National Federation of Independent Business reported a sharp drop in small business optimism last week, with owners citing tariffs as a threat. Industries like retail, reliant on imported goods, and tech, tied to global supply chains, could be particularly hard-hit.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq have posted their steepest daily drops since 2020, with the S&P 500 teetering on the edge of bear market territory, down over 8% year-to-date as of Friday, April 4. Reuters reports that $5.4 trillion in market value evaporated in just two trading sessions last week.
Analysts, including those at Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan attributed the rout to Trump’s tariffs. Michael Feroli, J.P. Morgan's chief economist has warned that the economic fallout from Trump's tariffs will include higher inflation, slower growth, and rising unemployment. The fallout could be seen in higher consumer prices, job cuts, and a surging recession risk.
Trump’s tariffs were billed as a tool to bring jobs home and level the playing field. Instead, they’ve unleashed chaos. The stock market’s nosedive reflects investor panic over disrupted supply chains and retaliatory measures from trading partners like China and the EU. Hedge funds and ETFs dumped over $40 billion in stocks last week, the largest net selling by long/short hedge funds in nearly 15 years, per Goldman Sachs.
 The bear market (stocks falling by 20%) looming over Wall Street shows no signs of abating. Industries tied to global supply chains like Apple, Tesla, and Nike have seen double-digit stock declines. Goldman Sachs now pegs the odds of a U.S. recession at 45%, up from 35% last week. J.P. Morgan’s outlook is darker, forecasting a 60% recession probability.
Trump shows no sign of backing down. Goldman Sachs estimates that tariffs on Canada and Mexico could push core inflation up by 0.7%, with retaliatory measures adding another 1-2%. Everyday goods such as avocados, smartphones, and lumber will be more expensive. This will be tough for household budgets.
J.P. Morgan predicts core PCE inflation hitting 4.4% by year-end, far above the Fed’s 2% target. Reduced consumer demand, coupled with higher production costs, threatens stagflation—rising prices paired with stagnant growth. GDP forecasts are grim. Moody’s Analytics’ Mark Zandi now sees a 40% recession risk, with a potential 2% GDP drop if trade tensions worsen.
